Due to the contributions of computer vision, deep learning, and sensitive sensors, autonomous driving systems (ADS) has now achieved great progress. But as we all know, the primary requirement for autonomous driving is absolute safety. However, technology innovation has brought great challenges to the testing of ADS, and due to the high cost of field testing, industrial companies rarely open relevant test data for research. This paper aims to study existing testing methods for ADS. Our study shows that there are few published works focusing on testing aspects of ADS. However, there is an obvious trend on the record of published works on testing ADS. Also, we can find that most reviewed works focus on setting up virtual test environment including generating, synthesizing, or reconstructing test input data. They either treat ADS as a whole to conduct (sub) system level testing or limit ADS into certain scenarios. From this, we believe that testing of ADS has just begun to attract researchers' interest; great effort should be paid before ADS becomes maturer.","","978-1-7281-8915-4","10.1109/QRS-C51114.2020.00048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9282713","Automated Driving Systems;Testing","Technological innovation;Software quality;Tools;Software reliability;Safety;Autonomous vehicles;Testing","","2","","13","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, ADS testing raises several challenges specific to the domain. Typical testing (coverage criteria, test generation, and oracle definition) and debugging activities performed for software programs are not directly applicable to ADSs, because of the lack of proper test oracles, and the difficulty of specifying the desired, correct ADS behavior. We tackle these challenges by extending and combining existing approaches to the domain of testing ADS. The approach is demonstrated on an industrial path planner. The path planner decides which path to follow through a cost function that uses parameters to assign a cost to the driving characteristics (e.g., lateral acceleration or speed) that must be applied in the path. These parameters implicitly describe the behavior of the ADS. We exploit this idea for defining a coverage criterion, for automatically specifying an oracle, and for debugging the path planner.","","978-1-6654-7921-9","10.1109/IVWorkshops54471.2021.9669254","Science Foundation Ireland; European Regional Development Fund; Irish Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9669254","","Costs;Conferences;Debugging;Cost function;Software;Test pattern generators;Autonomous vehicles","","2","","19","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unidentified fault signals from the sensors are reconstructed through the adaptive sliding mode observer. The reconstruction is based on the MIT rule through the use of an estimated sensitivity parameter. For the latter, a sliding mode control (SMC)-based emergency control method designed to respond to fault occurrences has been proposed to ensure the functional safety of autonomous vehicles. An adaptive gain parameter was designed, taking convergence time into consideration, to secure consistent and rapid responses from the controller. When the detection algorithm detects a fault, the appropriate control input is computed by a lower controller for the vehicle.

However, when a collision is found, it is not always easy to automatically assess whether the ADS should have been able to avoid it, without relying on offline analyses by domain experts. In this paper, we propose a definition of avoidable collision that does not rely on any domain knowledge, but only on the fact that it is possible to reconFigure the ADS (in our case, the path planner component provided by our industry partner) in a way that the collision is avoided. Based on this definition, we propose two search-based approaches for finding avoidable collisions. The first one (named sequential approach), based on current industrial practice, first searches for a collision, and then searches for an alternative configuration of the ADS which avoids it. The second one (named combined approach), instead, searches at the same time for the collision and for the alternative configuration which avoids it. Experiments show that the combined approach finds more avoidable collisions, even when the sequential approach doesn't find any; indeed, the sequential approach, in the first search, may find too severe collisions for which there is no alternative configuration that can avoid them.","2159-4848","978-1-7281-5778-8","10.1109/ICST46399.2020.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9159061","autonomous driving;path planner;avoidable collision;search-based testing","Automobiles;Testing;Safety;Industries;Autonomous vehicles;Autonomous automobiles;Acceleration","","59","","38","IEEE","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In autonomous driving systems, object detection serves as an intermediate module, which is used as the input of autonomous decisions for vehicles. That is, the accuracy of autonomous decisions relies on the object detection. The state-of-the-art object detection modules are designed based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). It is difficult to employ white-box testing on DNNs since the output of a single neuron is inexplicable. Existing work conducted metamorphic testing for object detection via image synthesis: the detected object in the original image should be detected in the new synthetic image. However, a synthetic image may not look real from humans' perspective. Even the object detection module fails in detecting such synthetic image, the failure may not reflect the ability of object detection. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to testing object detection via 3D reconstruction of vehicles in real photos. The 3D reconstruction is developed via vanishing point estimation in photos and heuristic based image insertion. Our approach adds new objects to blank spaces in photos to synthesize images. For example, a new vehicle can be added to a photo of a road and vehicles. In this approach, the output synthetic images are expected to be more natural-looking than randomly synthesizing images.

Most testing techniques consider virtualized SDCs within a simulation environment, whereas less effort has been directed towards assessing whether such techniques transfer to and are effective with a physical real-world vehicle. In this paper, we shed light on the problem of generalizing testing results obtained in a driving simulator to a physical platform and provide a characterization and quantification of the sim2real gap affecting SDC testing. In our empirical study, we compare SDC testing when deployed on a physical small-scale vehicle versus its digital twin. Due to the unavailability of driving quality indicators from the physical platform, we use neural rendering to estimate them through visual odometry, hence allowing full comparability with the digital twin. Then, we investigate the transferability of behavior and failure exposure between virtual and real-world environments, targeting both unintended abnormal test data and intended adversarial examples. Our study shows that, despite the usage of a faithful digital twin, there are still critical shortcomings that contribute to the reality gap between the virtual and physical world, threatening existing testing solutions that only consider virtual SDCs. On the positive side, our results present the test configurations for which physical testing can be avoided, either because their outcome does transfer between virtual and physical environments, or because the uncertainty profiles in the simulator can help predict their outcome in the real world.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3202311","ERC Advanced 2017 Program ERC(grant numbers:787703); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9869302","AI testing;self-driving cars;simulated testing;real-world testing;deep neural networks;autonomous vehicles","Testing;Automobiles;Roads;Behavioral sciences;Uncertainty;Predictive models;Safety","","36","","82","IEEE","29 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simulation-based testing is one of the main validation approaches, in which the ADS is run in a simulated environment over different scenarios. In this context, search-based testing (SBT) is used to generate scenarios that possibly expose particular failures of the ADS under test. Most SBT approaches search for behaviors of other traffic participants, but usually fix the road map of the scenario in advance. Recently, the SBT community started investigating the search for road structures, which is particularly useful when testing specific components of the ADS, such as the lane-keeping component. However, roads can be represented in multiple ways and the impact of using a particular representation on the effectiveness of SBT is unclear. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the usage of six road representations for SBT of ADSs. As a representative SBT approach, we test the lane-keeping component of an ADS in the BeamNG.tech simulator, aiming to generate roads in which the autonomous vehicle drives off the lane.

With the strong self-learning ability of neutral network, the initial membership function of the fuzzy system is updated through black box test and can indicate the probability of each fault type.

This paper evaluates different Bayesian uncertainty quantification methods from the deep learning domain for the anticipa-tory testing of safety-critical misbehaviours during system-level simulation-based testing. Specifically, we compute uncertainty scores as the vehicle executes, following the intuition that high uncertainty scores are indicative of unsupported runtime conditions that can be used to distinguish safe from failure-inducing driving behaviors. In our study, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness and computational overhead associated with two Bayesian uncertainty quantification methods, namely Me-Dropout and Deep Ensembles, for misbehaviour avoidance. Over-all, for three benchmarks from the Udacity simulator comprising both out-of-distribution and unsafe conditions introduced via mutation testing, both methods successfully detected a high number of out-of-bounds episodes providing early warnings several seconds in advance, outperforming two state-of-the-art misbehaviour prediction methods based on autoencoders and attention maps in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, Deep Ensembles detected most misbehaviours without any false alarms and did so even when employing a relatively small number of models, making them computationally feasible for real-time detection.

Recently, DNN testing has been intensively studied to automatically generate adversarial examples, which inject small-magnitude perturbations into inputs to test DNNs under extreme situations. While existing testing techniques prove to be effective, particularly for autonomous driving, they mostly focus on generating digital adversarial perturbations, e.g., changing image pixels, which may never happen in the physical world. Thus, there is a critical missing piece in the literature on autonomous driving testing: understanding and exploiting both digital and physical adversarial perturbation generation for impacting steering decisions. In this paper, we propose a systematic physical-world testing approach, namely DeepBillboard, targeting at a quite common and practical driving scenario: drive-by billboards. DeepBillboard is capable of generating a robust and resilient printable adversarial billboard test, which works under dynamic changing driving conditions including viewing angle, distance, and lighting. The objective is to maximize the possibility, degree, and duration of the steering-angle errors of an autonomous vehicle driving by our generated adversarial billboard. We have extensively evaluated the efficacy and robustness of DeepBillboard by conducting both experiments with digital perturbations and physical-world case studies. The digital experimental results show that DeepBillboard is effective for various steering models and scenes. Furthermore, the physical case studies demonstrate that DeepBillboard is sufficiently robust and resilient for generating physical-world adversarial billboard tests for real-world driving under various weather conditions, being able to mislead the average steering angle error up to 26.44 degrees. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the possibility of generating realistic and continuous physical-world tests for practical autonomous driving systems; moreover, DeepBillboard can be directly generalized to a variety of other physical entities/surfaces along the curbside, e.g., a graffiti painted on a wall.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-7121-6","","NSF(grant numbers:CNS 1527727,CCF-1566589,CNS CAREER 1750263,CCF-1704790); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902169); Shenzhen Peacock Plan(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283977","Autonomous Driving;Adversarial Machine Learning;Steering Model Testing","Systematics;Perturbation methods;Robustness;Vehicle dynamics;Autonomous vehicles;Testing;Software engineering","","26","","39","","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An important aspect in ADS testing is to cover different driving situations in which the autonomous car must perform different types of maneuvers. In this paper, we consider the path planner of our industry partner; the path planner is responsible for deciding the path that must be followed by the autonomous car. A path is characterized by the driving characteristics (as forward acceleration, lateral acceleration, curvature, and so on) that are needed, at each time point, to implement it. For different driving characteristics, a good test suite should contain a scenario for which the path planner chooses a path that requires the application of the selected driving characteristics for a non-negligible period of time: this means that the characteristics are relevant in that path. With such a test suite, engineers can observe the different types of decision taken by the path planner, and so possibly better assess its correctness. In the paper, we introduce the notion of patterns of driving characteristics, to characterize their interaction (i.e., simultaneous or not) and measure their duration. Exploiting this definition, we propose two search-based approaches (for single and pairs of driving characteristics) to find scenarios in which such patterns occur and their duration is maximized. Experimental results show that the approaches are effective in finding scenarios for which the path planner generates paths where the different driving characteristics occur in terms of the specified pattern.","2159-4848","978-1-7281-6836-4","10.1109/ICST49551.2021.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438591","autonomous driving systems;driving characteristics;path planner;search-based testing","Industries;Software testing;Conferences;Prototypes;Software;Autonomous automobiles;Autonomous vehicles","","20","","29","IEEE","24 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a need to rigorously test these models with real-world driving scenarios so that safety-critical bugs can be detected before their deployment in the real world.In this paper, we propose a combinatorial approach to testing DNN models. Our approach generates test images by applying a set of combinations of some basic image transformation operations to a seed image. First, we identify a set of valid transformation operations or simply transformations. Next, we design an input parameter model based on the valid transformations and generate a t-way (t=2) combinatorial test set. Each test represents a combination of transformations, and can be used to produce a test image. We execute the test images on a DNN model and distinguish between consistent and inconsistent behavior using a relation. We conducted an experimental evaluation of our approach on three DNN models that are used in the Udacity challenge. Our results suggest that test images generated by our approach can effectively identify inconsistent behaviors and can significantly increase neuron coverage.

While assuring their safety and reliability is, thus, of great importance, it is also a huge challenge. Metamorphic testing (MT) has been shown to be one of the most successful testing techniques to validate automated driving systems (ADS) underpinning the AV. Having said that, there are still lots of rooms for further improving the ADS testing with MT. On one hand, the non-determinism in ADS’ behaviors poses great challenges for precisely judging their correctness. On the other hand, the testing scenarios used in the existing studies are still not very much complex for mimicking various realistic traffic conditions. In this study, we propose a new framework which takes into account the hypothesis testing to provide a more solid way for judging the non-deterministic behaviors of test outcomes. On top of that, we develop a new toolkit to implement more complex and realistic ADS testing scenarios. To demonstrate its practicability, we design complex traffic scenarios and pay attention to examine the ADS’ behaviors in non-collision cases which are often unable to be detected by conventional testing methods. It is then applied to test Autoware, a state-of-the-art modular ADS using the Carla simulator. An analysis of results with the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test and Cohen’s d values reveals a large number of consistencies and reliability issues of Autoware. The findings highlight the flexibility and capability of our MT-based framework in validating the AV using a nondeterministic measure and realistic scenarios that can work in the absence of ground truth datasets.","","979-8-3503-0176-2","10.1109/MET59151.2023.00010","Australian Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10190416","Metamorphic testing;self-driving cars;autonomous vehicles;diversity of traffic scenarios","Art;Conferences;Buildings;Solids;Behavioral sciences;Safety;Reliability","","","","30","IEEE","27 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is worth to do further research on how and to what extent foggy weather affects autonomous driving systems. This paper proposes a test method, that can quantify the influence of fog for the autonomous driving system whose output is steering angle. The method relies on the metamorphic testing and proposes the metamorphic relations from the density and direction of fog to determine whether the autonomous driving system predicts inconsistent with driving behavior. In this paper, the density of the fog is divided into 5 levels according to GB/T 27964–2011, and the direction of the fog is divided into 9 directions according to the regional information, and the fog scene images with different densities and directions are simulated using OpenCV and CycleGAN. The results of relevant experiments carried out for three different autonomous driving systems show that the method can quantitatively and effectively detect a large number of failures in the autonomous driving system. Specifically, the autonomous driving system is rarely affected by the direction of fog, but the number of failures in the autonomous driving system is positively correlated with the density of fog, and it is more likely to fail in the case of dense fog.","2693-9371","978-1-6654-7836-6","10.1109/QRS-C55045.2021.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9742144","autonomous driving system;metamorphic testing;metamorphic relation;foggy driving scene","Density measurement;Software quality;Reliability engineering;Robustness;Software reliability;Safety;Security","","2","","37","IEEE","1 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This critical security problem necessitates the application of artificial intelligence (AI) models for anomaly detection in VANETs of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the lack of explainability of such AI-based anomaly detection models presents challenges. This motivates an emerging research direction of utilizing explainable AI (XAI) techniques to elucidate the behaviors of anomaly detection models in AV networks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end XAI framework to interpret and visualize the anomaly detection classifications made by AI models securing VANETs. We evaluate the framework on two real-world autonomous driving datasets. The framework furnishes both global and local explanations for the black-box AI models using two XAI methods. Moreover, we introduce two novel feature selection techniques to identify the salient features contributing to anomaly detection, derived from the popular SHAP XAI method and the accuracy of six different black-box AI models. We compare our proposed feature selection approaches with six state-of-the-art feature selection techniques (including two wrapper-based feature selection methods), demonstrating superior performance on various evaluation metrics. To generalize the impact of our feature selection methods, we apply three independent classifiers to evaluate our proposed feature selection approaches. The novel feature selection methods effectively distill the most explanatory features, enhancing model interpretability. Finally, we assess the efficiency (how quickly the XAI models can yield explanatory findings) for each of the six black-box AI models we employed on our two datasets, identifying the most efficient model. By furnishing explanations and visualizations of anomaly detection by AI models, our XAI framework can help in enabling trust and transparency for securing vehicular networks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3383431","Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis through the Lilly Endowment (AnalytixIN) Grant; Enhanced Mentoring Program with Opportunities for Ways to Excel in Research (EMPOWER) Grant; 1st Year Research Immersion Program (1RIP) Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10486915","Anomaly detection;autonomous driving;explainable AI;shapley additive explanations;LIME;feature extraction;VeReMi dataset","Feature extraction;Anomaly detection;Autonomous vehicles;Explainable AI;Closed box;Brain modeling;Data models;Autonomous driving;Data models","","5","","77","CCBYNCND","2 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing methods focus more on specific scenarios rather than global testing throughout the map. Testing on a global map is challenging since the complex lane connections in a map can generate enormous scenarios. In this work, we propose ATLAS, an approach to ADSs’ collision avoidance testing using map topology-based scenario classification. The core insight of ATLAS is to generate diverse testing scenarios by classifying junction lanes according to their topology-based interaction patterns. First, ATLAS divides the junction lanes into different classes such that an ADS can execute similar collision avoidance maneuvers on the lanes in the same class. Second, for each class, ATLAS selects one junction lane to construct the testing scenario and generate test cases using a genetic algorithm. Finally, we implement and evaluate ATLAS on Baidu Apollo with the LGSVL simulator on the San Francisco map. Results show that ATLAS exposes nine types of real issues in Apollo 6.0 and reduces the number of junction lanes for testing by 98%.","2643-1572","978-1-6654-0337-5","10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678735","Ministry of Education; National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678735","Autonomous Driving Systems;Collision Avoidance Testing;Scenario Classification","Systematics;Web and internet services;Software systems;Safety;Junctions;Collision avoidance;Autonomous vehicles","","8","","33","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Self-Driving Cars (SDCs) technology is one of the emerging technologies that is expected to provide numerous advantages. However, the public attitude is the critical factor that determine the extent to which these benefits can be realized. Previous studies show that while the public becomes more familiar with SDCs technology over time, people become more negative towards SDCs. The main scope of these studies is to investigate the influence of the demographic properties on the public perception of SDCs; however, the demographics do not significantly change over time and cannot translate the native shift in the public attitude over time. Consequently, this study focuses solely on investigating the influence of SDCs incidents on the public attitude and perception of this emerging technology using a questionnaire survey that was conducted in five different countries (US, Canada, UK, Netherlands, and Egypt) and 3123 responses were received from respondents with different demographic properties (gender and prior knowledge). The results show that the public attitude moves in the negative direction after the introduction of the accidents, especially for respondents from Europe who showed the highest level of shift (27% and 25% decrease in the interest and trust, and 31% increase in the concern).

However, its reliability and safety have drawn a lot of attention and concerns. This new paradigm poses unique challenges for testing. The expense and risk of testing an autonomous car algorithms on actual an autonomous vehicles are prohibitive. So many researchers cannot afford real AVs for testing on the roads. However, comprehensive and rigorous testing is crucial for ensuring that AVs can manage the wide range of conditions that can be seen on public roads. It is expensive and risky to test AVs on public roads. This is a challenge that is addressed by simulation testing, However, the disadvantage of simulation testing is that it is only as effective as the testing simulator and the degree to which the simulated situations faithfully represent the actual world. The fundamental characteristics that a successful simulator should have are outlined in this article. Further, we provide a comparison of commonly used simulators namely CARMAKER, CARLA, and LGSVL. Our analysis reveals that, for the reasons stated in this work, the Carmaker simulator is superior to the most cutting-edge simulators available now for testing self-driving cars end-to-end are CARLA and LGSVL.

Therefore, those tests can be characterized as “uninformative”, and running them generally means wasting precious computational resources. We address this issue with SDC-Scissor, a framework that leverages Machine Learning to identify simulation-based tests that are unlikely to detect faults in the SDC software under test and skip them before their execution. Consequently, by filtering out those tests, SDC-Scissor reduces the number of long-running simulations to execute and drastically increases the cost-effectiveness of simulation-based testing of SDCs software. Our evaluation concerning two large datasets and around 12'000 tests showed that SDC-Scissor achieved a higher classification F1-score (between 47% and 90%) than a randomized baseline in identifying tests that lead to a fault and reduced the time spent running uninformative tests (speedup between 107% and 170%).

However, satisfying all these requirements may not always be possible due to emerging environmental conditions. Therefore, the ADSs may have to make trade-offs among multiple requirements during the ongoing operation, resulting in one or more requirements violations. For ADS engineers, it is highly important to know which combinations of requirements violations may occur, as different combinations can expose different types of failures. However, there is currently no testing approach that can generate scenarios to expose different combinations of requirements violations. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce the notion of requirements violation pattern to characterize a specific combination of requirements violations. Based on this notion, we propose a testing approach named EMOOD that can effectively generate test scenarios to expose as many requirements violation patterns as possible. EMOOD uses a prioritization technique to sort all possible patterns to search for, from the most to the least critical ones. Then, EMOOD iteratively includes an evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm to find different combinations of requirements violations. In each iteration, the targeted pattern is determined by a dynamic prioritization technique to give preferences to those patterns with higher criticality and higher likelihood to occur. We apply EMOOD to an industrial ADS under two common traffic situations. Evaluation results show that EMOOD outperforms three baseline approaches in generating test scenarios by discovering more requirements violation patterns.","2643-1572","978-1-6654-0337-5","10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678883","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678883","Many-Objective Optimization;Autonomous Driving Systems;Requirements-Based Testing","Heuristic algorithms;Safety;Complex systems;Autonomous vehicles;Optimization;Testing;Software engineering","","22","","48","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For ADS of SAE level 3+, the scenario space is infinite and calling for virtual testing and verification. The biggest challenge for virtual testing methods lies in the realistic representation of the virtual environment where the ADS is tested. Such an environment shall provide the possibility to model and develop vehicles, objects, control algorithms, traffic participants and environment elements in order to generate valid and representative test data. An important and crucial aspect of such environments is the testing of vehicles in a complex traffic environment with a stochastic and realistic traffic representation. For this research we used a microscopic traffic flow simulation software (TFSS) PTV Vissim and the vehicle simulation software IPG CarMaker to test ADS. Although the TFSS provides realistic and stochastic behavior of traffic participants, the occurrence of safety-critical scenarios (SCS) is not guaranteed. To generate and increase such scenarios, a novel stress testing method (STM) is introduced. With this method, traffic participants are manipulated in the vicinity of the vehicle under test in order to provoke SCS derived from statistical accident data on motorways in Austria. Using the co-simulation between IPG CarMaker, PTV Vissim and external driver models in Vissim are used to imitate human driving errors, resulting in an increase of SCS.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3044024","Austrian Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology as part of the FFG Program “EFREtop.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290063","Automatic testing;autonomous vehicles;scenario generation;ADAS","Stochastic processes;Virtual environments;Software;Stress;Testing;Accidents;Vehicles","","19","","42","CCBY","10 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To ensure realism, numerical robustness and usability of the test scenarios for both approaches, increasing effort must be invested in modelling the driving environment as well as vehicle and traffic dynamics. Especially traffic models are rarely realistically modelled in most current scenario generation and testing techniques.

Prior research introduced simulation-based testing for SDCs, with Frenetic, a test generation approach based on Frenet space encoding, achieving a relatively high percentage of valid tests (approximately 50%) characterized by naturally smooth curves. The “minimal out-of-bound distance” is often taken as a fitness function, which we argue to be a sub-optimal metric. Instead, we show that the likelihood of leading to an out-of-bound condition can be learned by the deep-learning vanilla transformer model. We combine this “inherently learned metric” with a genetic algorithm, which has been shown to produce a high diversity of tests. To validate our approach, we conducted a large-scale empirical evaluation on a dataset comprising over 1,174 simulated test cases created to challenge the SDCs behavior. Our investigation revealed that our approach demonstrates a substantial reduction in generating non-valid test cases, increased diversity, and high accuracy in identifying safety violations during SDC test execution.","","979-8-4007-0562-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10699907","","Measurement;Fuzzing;Diversity methods;Transformers;Encoding;Safety;Autonomous automobiles;Test pattern generators;Testing;Genetic algorithms","","","","18","CCBY","4 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A challenge for SDC maintainers and testers is the need to manually define the CAN inputs that realistically represent the state of the SDC in the real world. To address this challenge, we developed TEASER; a tool that generates realistic CAN signals for SDCs obtained from sensors from state-of-the-art car simulators. We evaluated TEASER based on its integration capability into a DevOps pipeline of aicas GmbH, a company in the automotive sector. Concretely, we integrated TEASER in a Continous Integration (CI) pipeline configured with Jenkins.

Our evaluation shows the ability of TEASER to generate and execute CI test cases that expose simulation-based faults (using regression strategies); the tool produces CAN inputs that realistically represent the state of the SDC in the real world.

Among the others, virtual testing is expected to play a major role in the future. Differently from other methods, virtual testing allows examining an ADS in complex driving scenarios involving several road users and characterized by any level of criticality in a safe, efficient and effective way. However, before virtual testing can be used in the ADS certification process, proper validation methodologies have to be established to ensure the appropriateness of the simulation-generated evidence to the end of establishing a “virtual proving ground” regardless of the specific ADS. In this context, the present paper summarizes the results of the virtual environment validation exercise which involved a Vehicle-Hardware-in-the-Loop (VeHIL) setup against real-world experiments. The analysis only embraces the longitudinal dynamics due to the limitation of the virtual environment. Nonetheless, the methodology presented can be straightforwardly extended to different toolchains to cover more advanced ADS for the sake of virtual certification. The manuscript has a twofold contribution. On one side, it gives a quantitative estimation of the fidelity level achievable using a state-of-the-art VeHIL environment, thus standing apart from validation activities purely based on qualitative comparisons and contributions mostly concerned with the validation of the ADS itself. Secondly, it provides an end-to-end validation procedure that could be generalized to other cases of study or different testing setups. The results achieved are encouraging as they show an overall good match between real-world and simulated data. However, open issues remain in order to define a complete validation framework for virtual testing environments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3171180","European Commission Joint Research Centre; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9765490","Automated driving;model validation;simulation;virtual testing","Testing;Vehicle dynamics;Certification;Pipelines;Standards;Europe;Virtual environments","","8","","32","CCBY","29 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the essential testing phases of such DNN-enabled systems is online testing, where the system under test is embedded into a specific and often simulated application environment (e.g., a driving environment) and tested in a closed-loop mode in interaction with the environment. However, despite the importance of online testing for detecting safety violations, automatically generating new and diverse test data that lead to safety violations presents the following challenges: (1) there can be many safety requirements to be considered at the same time, (2) running a high-fidelity simulator is often very computationally-intensive, and (3) the space of all possible test data that may trigger safety violations is too large to be exhaustively explored. In this paper, we address the challenges by proposing a novel approach, called SAMOTA (Surrogate-Assisted Many-Objective Testing Approach), extending existing many-objective search algorithms for test suite generation to efficiently utilize surrogate models that mimic the simulator, but are much less expensive to run. Empirical evaluation results on Pylot, an advanced ADS composed of multiple DNNs, using CARLA, a high-fidelity driving simulator, show that SAMOTA is significantly more effective and efficient at detecting unknown safety requirement violations than state-of-the-art many-objective test suite generation algorithms and random search. In other words, SAMOTA appears to be a key enabler technology for online testing in practice.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-9221-1","10.1145/3510003.3510188","National Research Fund(grant numbers:BRIDGES2020/IS/14711346/FUNTASY); European Research Council(grant numbers:694277); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2019R1A6A3A03033444); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9794023","DNN testing;online testing;many-objective search;surrogate-assisted optimization;self-driving cars","Software testing;Deep learning;Software algorithms;Neural networks;Safety;Software reliability;Optimization","","21","","45","CCBY","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ensuring the correct behavior of such DNN-Enabled Systems (DES) is a crucial topic. Online testing is one of the promising modes for testing such systems with their application environments (simulated or real) in a closed loop, taking into account the continuous interaction between the systems and their environments. However, the environmental variables (e.g., lighting conditions) that might change during the systems' operation in the real world, causing the DES to violate requirements (safety, functional), are often kept constant during the execution of an online test scenario due to the two major challenges: (1) the space of all possible scenarios to explore would become even larger if they changed and (2) there are typically many requirements to test simultaneously. In this paper, we present MORLOT (Many-Objective Rein-forcement Learning for Online Testing), a novel online testing approach to address these challenges by combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and many-objective search. MORLOT leverages RL to incrementally generate sequences of environmental changes while relying on many-objective search to determine the changes so that they are more likely to achieve any of the uncovered objectives. We empirically evaluate MORLOT using CARLA, a high-fidelity simulator widely used for autonomous driving research, integrated with Transfuser, a DNN-enabled ADS for end-to-end driving. The evaluation results show that MORLOT is significantly more effective and efficient than alternatives with a large effect size. In other words, MORLOT is a good option to test DES with dynamically changing environments while accounting for multiple safety requirements.","1558-1225","978-1-6654-5701-9","10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00155","NSERC of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172658","DNN Testing;Reinforcement learning;Many objective search;Self-driving cars;Online testing","Q-learning;Systems operation;Scalability;Lighting;Search problems;Safety;Task analysis","","14","","42","IEEE","14 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address the safety issues in autonomous driving systems, a recent set of testing techniques have been designed to automatically generate artificial driving scenes to enrich test suite, e.g., generating new input images transformed from the original ones. However, these techniques are insufficient due to two limitations: first, many such synthetic images often lack diversity of driving scenes, and hence compromise the resulting efficacy and reliability. Second, for machine-learning-based systems, a mismatch between training and application domain can dramatically degrade system accuracy, such that it is necessary to validate inputs for improving system robustness. In this paper, we propose DeepRoad, an unsupervised DNN-based framework for automatically testing the consistency of DNN-based autonomous driving systems and online validation. First, DeepRoad automatically synthesizes large amounts of diverse driving scenes without using image transformation rules (e.g. scale, shear and rotation). In particular, DeepRoad is able to produce driving scenes with various weather conditions (including those with rather extreme conditions) by applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) along with the corresponding real-world weather scenes. Second, DeepRoad utilizes metamorphic testing techniques to check the consistency of such systems using synthetic images. Third, DeepRoad validates input images for DNN-based systems by measuring the distance of the input and training images using their VGGNet features. We implement DeepRoad to test three well-recognized DNN-based autonomous driving systems in Udacity self-driving car challenge. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepRoad can detect thousands of inconsistent behaviors for these systems, and effectively validate input images to potentially enhance the system robustness as well.","2643-1572","978-1-4503-5937-5","10.1145/3238147.3238187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9000040","Software testing;Test generation;Input validation;Deep Neural Networks","","","228","1","45","","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work is motivated by the fact that on-road human-drivers’ behaviour is unknown and difficult to be predicted. Transmissibility operators are mathematical operators that relate one subset of outputs to another in the same system. The transmissibility superiority is represented in the in-dependency on the system excitation signals. We reformulate the system dynamics to render the system inputs, external disturbances, as well as the human-drivers’ behaviour along with any other nonlinearities as independent excitation signals on the system. Therefore, the transmissibility operators become independent of the human-drivers’ behaviour and robust against external disturbances. Transmissibilities are then applied to detect and localize physical and cyber faults within the platoon. Then these faults are mitigated using a transmissibility-based sliding mode controller. The controller stability and the string stability are investigated while the controller is active and the faults are mitigated. We validate the proposed algorithm on a model of the platoon obtained using the bond graph approach. Moreover, we apply the proposed algorithm experimentally to a platoon consisting of three robots (i.e. two autonomous robots and a human-driven robot), that is connected using wireless communications. Note to Practitioners—The existence of connected autonomous vehicles depends greatly on the smooth transition between the current on-road human-driven vehicles to autonomous vehicles. The typical methods of securing dynamic systems depend on estimating the system behaviour and responses. Increasing the number of autonomous vehicles on roads necessitates the typical securing techniques to estimate the human-drivers’ behaviour. Thus, securing the connected autonomous vehicles during this transition is challenging since the on-road human-driver behavior is unknown and difficult to be estimated. Moreover, connected autonomous vehicles should adapt to their environment while maintaining their role within the autonomous platoon. This adaptation includes adapting to the unknown human-driver behaviour. This inspired the authors to develop the proposed transmissibility-based fault mitigation. The proposed technique is shown to be able to handle unknown human-driver behaviors, different driving conditions such as road irregularities and different weather conditions, and different physical and cyber faults (i.e., in the vehicles or in the communication links). The platoon stability is then investigated while the faults are mitigated, and shown to guarantee the platoon stability.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3188415","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Memorial University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9844148","Connected autonomous vehicles;transmissibility;output-only relations;bond graphs;fault detection;fault mitigation;string stability","Autonomous vehicles;Heuristic algorithms;Vehicle dynamics;Monitoring;Behavioral sciences;Safety;Fault detection","","4","","44","IEEE","28 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, this paper proposes a compression method for LIDAR data. Firstly, the time-series LIDAR data are rearranged into azimuth-altitude two-dimensional signal spaces. Secondly, the two-dimensional data are transferred into frequency domain by using the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Thirdly, the time-series DCT data are sampled based on differential sampling. Finally, the whole set of data are encoded using Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-algorithm (LZMA). Meanwhile, this paper also presents the remote control of autonomous vehicles. The videos are streamed from the vehicle while the control commands are issued through a gamepad.

This kind of problem is called the test oracle problem.

In this context, quality defines the degree to which an object meets expectations and requirements. Especially, highly automated and automated vehicles at SAE levels 4 and 5 will be expected to operate safely in various contexts and complex situations without misconduct. Thus, a systematic approach is needed to show their safe operation. A way to address this challenge is simulation-based testing, as pure physical testing is not feasible for automated driving at levels 4 and 5 since several billion kilometers of driving are necessary. During simulation-based testing, the data used to evaluate the actual quality of an automated driving system are generated using a simulation. However, to rely on these simulation data, the overall simulation, including its simulation models, must provide a certain quality level. This quality level depends on the intended purpose for which the generated simulation data should be used. Therefore, three categories of quality can be considered: simulation quality (e.g., reliable simulation tool), quality of the automated driving system (e.g., handling of dangerous situations), and scenario quality (e.g., scenario criticality). Quality must be determined and evaluated in various process steps in developing and testing automated driving systems, the overall simulation, and the simulation models used for the simulation. In this paper, we propose a conceptual taxonomy to better understand quality in the development and testing process to have a clear separation and insight where further testing is needed – both in terms of automated driving systems and simulation, including their simulation models and scenarios used for testing.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3149542","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy within the Project “Simulationsbasiertes Entwickeln und Testen von automatisiertem Fahren (SET Level)-Simulation-Based Development and Testing of Automated Driving,” a Successor Project to the Project “Projekt zur Etablierung von generell akzeptierten Gütekriterien, Werkzeugen und Methoden sowie Szenarien und Situationen zur Freigabe hochautomatisierter Fahrfunktionen (PEGASUS)” and a Project in the PEGASUS Family; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9706219","Automated driving;criticality;metrics;PEGASUS family;quality;scenario;scenario-based testing;simulation;taxonomy;validation;verification","Autonomous driving;Simulation;Data models;Automation;Solid modeling","","12","","56","CCBY","7 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This approach results in training and test datasets with dissimilar distributions, which can potentially lead to erroneously decreased test accuracy. To address this issue, the literature suggests applying domain-to-domain translators to test datasets to bring them closer to the training datasets. However, translating images used for testing may unpredictably affect the reliability, effectiveness and efficiency of the testing process. Hence, this paper investigates the following questions in the context of ADS: Could translators reduce the effectiveness of images used for ADS-DNN testing and their ability to reveal faults in ADS-DNNs? Can translators result in excessive time overhead during simulation-based testing? To address these questions, we consider three domain-to-domain translators: CycleGAN and neural style transfer, from the literature, and SAEVAE, our proposed translator. Our results for two critical ADS tasks – lane keeping and object detection – indicate that translators significantly narrow the gap in ADS test accuracy caused by distribution dissimilarities between training and test data, with SAEVAE outperforming the other two translators. We show that, based on the recent diversity, coverage, and fault-revealing ability metrics for testing deep-learning systems, translators do not compromise the diversity and the coverage of test data nor do they lead to revealing fewer faults in ADS-DNNs. Further, among the translators considered, SAEVAE incurs a negligible overhead in simulation time and can be efficiently integrated into simulation-based testing. Finally, we show that translators increase the correlation between offline and simulation-based testing results, which can help reduce the cost of simulation-based testing.

A common goal in ADS testing is to find scenarios in which the car collides, as these could witness ADS faults. Recent approaches not only find a collision, but they also show whether it could be avoided: they search for a different ADS configuration (i.e., the setting of some parameters) using which the car does not collide. However, such techniques do not explain why the collision occurs and why the alternative configuration is able to avoid it. In this paper, we propose an approach to investigate the relationship between the ADS configurations and the obtained safety during driving. We first use a technique based on fuzzification to partition ADS parameters in different categories, and a spectra- based analysis to identify which categories relate to hazard and safety. Then, we consider collision scenarios by inspecting how the different ADS configurations affect the driving characteristics (e.g., acceleration and curvature) and, so, cause or avoid a collision. We applied the approach to the path planner of our industry partner, by considering three traffic situations. We observed that the path planner, to guarantee safety, should be configured differently in different situations.","2332-6549","978-1-7281-9870-5","10.1109/ISSRE5003.2020.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9251094","autonomous driving systems;path planner;configuration;hazard;safety;collision;fault localization","Location awareness;Industries;Hazards;Autonomous automobiles;Automobiles;Autonomous vehicles;Testing","","7","","52","IEEE","11 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most major manufacturers including Tesla, GM, Ford, BMW, and Waymo/Google are working on building and testing different types of autonomous vehicles. The lawmakers of several US states including California, Texas, and New York have passed new legislation to fast-track the process of testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles on their roads. However, despite their spectacular progress, DNNs, just like traditional software, often demonstrate incorrect or unexpected corner-case behaviors that can lead to potentially fatal collisions. Several such real-world accidents involving autonomous cars have already happened including one which resulted in a fatality. Most existing testing techniques for DNN-driven vehicles are heavily dependent on the manual collection of test data under different driving conditions which become prohibitively expensive as the number of test conditions increases. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate DeepTest, a systematic testing tool for automatically detecting erroneous behaviors of DNN-driven vehicles that can potentially lead to fatal crashes. First, our tool is designed to automatically generated test cases leveraging real-world changes in driving conditions like rain, fog, lighting conditions, etc. DeepTest systematically explore different parts of the DNN logic by generating test inputs that maximize the numbers of activated neurons. DeepTest found thousands of erroneous behaviors under different realistic driving conditions (e.g., blurring, rain, fog, etc.) many of which lead to potentially fatal crashes in three top performing DNNs in the Udacity self-driving car challenge.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-5638-1","10.1145/3180155.3180220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8453089","deep learning;testing;self-driving cars;deep neural networks;autonomous vehicle;neuron coverage","Neurons;Autonomous automobiles;Software;Testing;Automobiles;Sensors;Computer architecture","","477","5","87","","2 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far, the effectiveness of these approaches has been hindered by their reliance on random fuzzing or transformations that do not always produce test cases with a good diversity. To overcome these limitations, we propose, DeepEvolution, a novel search-based approach for testing DL models that relies on metaheuristics to ensure a maximum diversity in generated test cases. We assess the effectiveness of DeepEvolution in testing computer-vision DL models and found that it significantly increases the neuronal coverage of generated test cases. Moreover, using DeepEvolution, we could successfully find several corner-case behaviors.

We distinguish two general modes of testing for DNNs: Offline testing where DNNs are tested as individual units based on test datasets obtained independently from the DNNs under test, and online testing where DNNs are embedded into a specific application and tested in a close-loop mode in interaction with the application environment. In addition, we identify two sources for generating test datasets for DNNs: Datasets obtained from real-life and datasets generated by simulators. While offline testing can be used with datasets obtained from either sources, online testing is largely confined to using simulators since online testing within real-life applications can be time consuming, expensive and dangerous. In this paper, we study the following two important questions aiming to compare test datasets and testing modes for DNNs: First, can we use simulator-generated data as a reliable substitute to real-world data for the purpose of DNN testing? Second, how do online and offline testing results differ and complement each other? Though these questions are generally relevant to all autonomous systems, we study them in the context of automated driving systems where, as study subjects, we use DNNs automating end-to-end control of cars' steering actuators. Our results show that simulator-generated datasets are able to yield DNN prediction errors that are similar to those obtained by testing DNNs with real-life datasets. Further, offline testing is more optimistic than online testing as many safety violations identified by online testing could not be identified by offline testing, while large prediction errors generated by offline testing always led to severe safety violations detectable by online testing.","2159-4848","978-1-7281-5778-8","10.1109/ICST46399.2020.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9159088","DNN;ADS;testing;simulation","Testing;Safety;Cameras;Autonomous systems;Roads;Electronic mail;Reliability","","41","","33","IEEE","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the rapid progress in computationally powerful artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, AVs can sense their environment with high precision, make safe real-time decisions, and operate reliably without human intervention. However, intelligent decision-making in such vehicles is not generally understandable by humans in the current state of the art, and such deficiency hinders this technology from being socially acceptable. Hence, aside from making safe real-time decisions, AVs must also explain their AI-guided decision-making process in order to be regulatory-compliant across many jurisdictions. Our study sheds comprehensive light on the development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches for AVs. In particular, we make the following contributions. First, we provide a thorough overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging approaches for XAI-based autonomous driving.

Despite these advantages, virtual simulations often fail to accurately replicate real-world conditions like image fidelity, texture representation, and environmental accuracy. This can lead to significant differences in ADS behavior between simulated and real-world domains, a phenomenon known as the sim2real gap. Researchers have used Image-to-Image (I2I) neural translation to mitigate the sim2real gap, enhancing the realism of simulated environments by transforming synthetic data into more authentic representations of real-world conditions. However, while promising, these techniques may potentially introduce artifacts, distortions, or inconsistencies in the generated data that can affect the effectiveness of ADS testing. In our empirical study, we investigated how the quality of image-to-image (I2I) techniques influences the mitigation of the sim2real gap, using a set of established metrics from the literature. We evaluated two popular generative I2I architectures, pix2pix and CycleGAN, across two ADS perception tasks at a model level, namely vehicle detection and end-to-end lane keeping, using paired simulated and real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that the effectiveness of I2I architectures varies across different ADS tasks, and existing evaluation metrics do not consistently align with the ADS behavior. Thus, we conducted task-specific fine-tuning of perception metrics, which yielded a stronger correlation. Our findings indicate that a perception metric that incorporates semantic elements, tailored to each task, can facilitate selecting the most appropriate I2I technique for a reliable assessment of the sim2real gap mitigation.","2159-4848","979-8-3503-0818-1","10.1109/ICST60714.2024.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10638598","autonomous vehicles testing;generative adversarial networks;sim2real;reality gap","Measurement;Software testing;Prevention and mitigation;Vehicle detection;Computer architecture;Software reliability;Task analysis","","2","","97","IEEE","27 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Variety of scenario generation techniques have been advocated, including real-world data analysis, accident data analysis and via systems hazard analysis. While scenario generation can be done via these methods, there is a need for a scenario description language format which enables the exchange of scenarios between diverse stakeholders (as part of the systems engineering lifecycle) with varied usage requirements.

SDL level 2 is a formal machine-readable language which is ingested by testing platform e.g. simulation or test track.

However, the scarcity of risky driving events distributed in real-world driving often makes sampling inefficient. In this paper, we propose a unified and hierarchical testing framework for efficient and unbiased safety tests of ADS. We first extract the risk subspace from the Naturalistic Driving Data (NDD) with defined safety measures. Subsequently, we use the Gaussian Copula method to accurately model the subspace joint probability density function (PDF). We further formulate a Kriging model-based optimization problem for finding the appropriate Importance Sampling (IS) parameters, where the Kriging model is trained iteratively within limited computational resources. Eventually, the risky concrete scenarios library is generated using the obtained Importance Sampling parameters. With the simulation results skewered back to the original risk subspace, the ADS probability of failure (e.g., crash rate) can thus be accurately and unbiasedly estimated. Experiment results show that using 0.94% computational resources, the Kriging surrogate model captures 96.04% of ADS crashes with at least 90.25% precision. On crash rate estimation, our proposed method achieves a consistent result with that of Monte Carlo simulation, provided that the relative error does not exceed 10% while improving the testing efficiency by up to 6,539 times.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2022.3213310","CAS Key Laboratory of Human-Machine Intelligence-Synergy Systems; Shenzhen Engineering Laboratory for Autonomous Driving Technology; Science and Technology Development Fund, Macao S.A.R.(grant numbers:0015/2019/AKP,2019B121205007); National Natural Science Funds of China for Young Scholar(grant numbers:62003328); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M682985); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B515130004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9915421","Autonomous driving system;naturalistic driving data;risk subspace;unbiased test;efficiency","Safety;Monte Carlo methods;Probability density function;Accidents;Testing;Computational modeling;Autonomous vehicles","","10","","52","IEEE","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The scenario library defines the parameter of each testing scenario, which reduces testing by merging similar scenarios and focusing on challenging scenarios. However, current scenario generation methods still bear some disadvantages, such as lack of data and low efficiency. In order to overcome the lack of data, this paper proposed a genetic algorithm-based framework for the cut-in event and car-following event. In this study, the genetic algorithm searches for one of the most challenging scenarios within the boundaries. The challenging scenario is acquired by the brute force search algorithm which searches from the start scenario. The result shows the ratio of accident scenarios to challenging scenarios in our scenario set is more than 40%. Compared with natural driving data scenarios, our method performs well without natural driving data. In addition, the genetic algorithm converges in ten iterations which indicates its efficiency and suitability in scenario generation. More specifically, whole challenging scenarios which probably occur in the real world are collected in the scenario set.","2469-7281","","10.1109/JRFID.2022.3223092","Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B0909050003); Guangdong Rural Science and Technology Correspondent Foundation(grant numbers:KTP20200221); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9955390","Automated driving;intelligent testing;simulation;genetic algorithm;scenes generation","Accidents;Testing;Genetic algorithms;Safety;Radiofrequency identification;Indexes;Autonomous vehicles","","10","","17","IEEE","18 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given a specific test goal, a generation approach (e.g., search-based testing) is usually employed to find a scenario covering such goal; for example, it can find a scenario in which the autonomous vehicle collides. The generated scenarios may contain some elements that are irrelevant for the achievement of the test goal; if this is the case for a scenario that exposes a failure, for ADS engineers it is difficult to identify the root cause, as the ADS interacts with several traffic participants and it is not clear which of these are essential to trigger the failure. This problem emerged during the collaboration with our industry partner, for which, in the past, we proposed different test generation approaches for their ADS path planner, but these may produce test scenarios that are not minimal. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an approach that, given an ADS test scenario, simplifies it by removing all the traffic participants that are not needed. As output, the approach provides a scenario that still covers the test goal as the initial scenario, but contains the minimum number of traffic participants. The approach consists in iteratively generating simplified scenarios by removing some traffic participants and determining, by observing the test execution, which can be actually removed and which must be kept in the scenario. Three policies are investigated to remove traffic participants whose classification is not know: single policy, binary policy, and adaptive policy. Experiments have been conducted on several scenarios generated for the path planner. Results show that the binary policy is the one that usually can find the minimal scenario with the minimum number of simplification attempts, but, in particular cases, the adaptive policy is better.","2159-4848","978-1-6654-6679-0","10.1109/ICST53961.2022.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9787893","autonomous driving systems;simulation-based testing;scenario;simplification","Industries;Software testing;System testing;Conferences;Collaboration;Automobiles;Test pattern generators","","5","","47","IEEE","8 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, the testing process to find faulty behavior may continue forever. There is a practical need for test ending criteria for both of the following problems: Did we test all scenario types? Did we sufficiently test each type with specific instances? We address the first question and present a suitable test ending criterion and methodology. Whether the system is tested in each scenario type is reduced to the question whether all test scenarios are known.

When the sensor soft fault of AUV is detected by the traditional method of observer based on the means of close-loop control and close-loop detection, the sensor measured value with fault information is fed into the input of observer, which will affect the output of observer and make it track with the measured value of sensor. Meanwhile, as the sensor information with fault is fed into the controller, the fault of sensor will be compensated by the adjusting function of controller. To solve the problem that it is difficult to detect the soft fault of sensors from the state data of AUV and the output of observer, the paper presents a novel diagnosis method to detect the sensor soft fault. Based on the means of close-loop control and open-loop detection, it constructed the open-loop state observer model using RBF neural network and take the observer residual and actual residual as the judicative residual and the basis residual respectively. The sensor condition is adjudged according to the different trend of the two kinds of residual mentioned above. In the process of training of RBF neural network state observer, the selective method of initial center is improved and the repeated selection of initial center is avoided. The experiment results show that the improved RBF learning algorithm has faster convergence speed and better training effect. The pool experimental results prove that the method of sensor soft fault detection is feasible and effective for the autonomous underwater vehicle.","2152-744X","978-1-4244-2692-8","10.1109/ICMA.2009.5246397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5246397","Autonomous underwater vehicle;Sensor soft fault;Fault detection;RBF neural network","Fault detection;Underwater vehicles;Fault diagnosis;Sea measurements;Open loop systems;Neural networks;Oceans;Condition monitoring;Marine safety;Vehicle safety","","1","","8","IEEE","18 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The adaptive sliding mode observer (ASMO) using recursive least squares (RLS) for reconstruction of acceleration sensor fault signal has been designed with gradient descent method. The reconstructed fault signal has been used to compute the desired acceleration for fault-tolerant longitudinal control with the Lyapunov stability condition. In order to compute the lower-level control inputs such as acceleration and brake pedal inputs, the desired and current acceleration values have been used based on the PID control law. It is assumed that the longitudinal acceleration of the preceding vehicle can be obtained using V2V communication.

The values of the perturbation determined by this process provide parameters that define participants' trajectories. To improve the efficiency of the search, we design a local fuzzer that increases the exploitation of local optima in the areas where highly likely safety-hazardous situations are observed.

In order to assure safety and provide confidence to the public in the safety of SAVs, researchers around the world have used coverage-based testing for Verification and Validation (V&V) and safety assurance of SAVs. The objective of this paper is to investigate the coverage criteria proposed and coverage maximizing techniques used by researchers in the last decade up till now, to assure safety of SAVs. We conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) for this investigation in our paper. We present a classification of existing research based on the coverage criteria used.

However, autonomous driving systems are highly safety critical in nature and need to be thoroughly tested for a diverse set of conditions before being commercially deployed. Due to the huge complexities involved with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving Systems (ADS), traditional software testing methods have well-known limitations. They also fail to cover the infinite number of adverse conditions that can occur due to a slight change in the interactions between the environment and the system. Hence, it is important to identify test conditions that push the vehicle under test to breach its safe boundaries. Hazard Based Testing (HBT) methods, inspired by Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), identify such parameterized test conditions that can lead to system failure. However, these techniques fall short of discovering the exact parameter values that lead to the failure condition. The presented paper proposes a test case identification technique using Bayesian Optimization. For a given test scenario, the proposed method learns parameter values by observing the system's output. The identified values create test cases that drive the system to violate its safe boundaries. STPA inspired outputs (parameters and pass/fail criteria) are used as inputs to the Bayesian Optimization model. The proposed method was applied to an SAE Level-4 Low Speed Automated Driving (LSAD) system which was modelled in a driving simulator.","","978-1-5386-7024-8","10.1109/ITSC.2019.8917103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8917103","","Optimization;Testing;Bayes methods;Fuels;Hazards;Heuristic algorithms","","29","","28","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to solve the problem of low defect scene coverage and scene complexity in the test scenarios of autonomous driving systems, a generalized defect scene generation method based on the attention mechanism is proposed to achieve the automatic generation of high-complexity defect scenes. Firstly, the scene is abstracted into a logical scene model that changes dynamically over time by combining environmental information and vehicle dynamics model; then, the scene controller modeling problem is abstracted into a Markov decision process, and the SA-DDQN (Social Attention Double Deep Q-Network) algorithm is proposed based on the attention mechanism. Constructing the multi-attention mechanism into the strategy model can make the ego vehicle more effective in capturing the complex interactions between input variables and focusing on potentially dangerous vehicles that are close to or in conflict with the planned path. Thus, it solves the problems of low percentage of defective scenarios, low generation efficiency, low scenario complexity, etc., and accelerates the testing process. Finally, a typical highway lane-changing overtaking scenario is taken as an example for simulation verification. The results show that the defective scene model generated based on the proposed SA-DDQN algorithm performs well in terms of scene interaction, scene coverage and repeatable testing.","","979-8-3503-5021-0","10.1109/ICCCS61882.2024.10602973","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52202489,52172380); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10602973","intelligent driving testing;reinforcement learning;s cenario dynamics;defect scenarios","Road transportation;System testing;Attention mechanisms;Heuristic algorithms;Markov decision processes;Input variables;Life estimation","","","","22","IEEE","1 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, we measured the correlation between such metrics and the human perception of driving quality when AVs are driving. Lastly, we performed a study based on mutation analysis to assess whether the 26 metrics that best capture the quality of AV driving according to the human study can be used as functional oracles.

Human drivers can be completely taken out of the loop through the implementation of safe and intelligent autonomous vehicles. Although we can say that HW and SW development continues to play a large role in the automotive industry, test and validation of these systems is a must. The ability to test these vehicles thoroughly and efficiently will ensure their proper and flawless operation. When a large number of people with heterogeneous knowledge and skills try to develop an autonomous vehicle together, it is important to use a sensible engineering process. State of the art techniques for such development include Waterfall, Agile & V-model, where test & validation (T&V) process is an integral part of such a development cycle. This paper will propose a new methodology using machine learning & deep neural network (AI-core) for lab & real-world T&V for ADAS (Advanced driver assistance system) and autonomous vehicles. The methodology will initially connect T&V of individual systems in each level of development and that of complete system efficiently, by using the proposed phase methodology, in which autonomous driving functions are grouped under categories, special T&V processes are carried on simulation as well as in HIL systems. The complete transition towards AI in the field of T&V will be a sequence of steps. Initially the AI-core is fed with available test scenarios, boundary conditions for the test cases and scenarios, and examples, the AI-core will conduct virtual tests on simulation environment using available test scenarios and further generates new test cases and scenarios for efficient and precise tests. These test cases and scenarios are meant to cover all available cases and concentrate on the area where bugs or failures occur. The complete surrounding environment in the simulation is also controlled by the AI-core which means that the system can attain endless/all-possible combinations of the surrounding environment which is necessary. Results of the tests are sorted and stored, critical and important tests are again repeated in the real-world environment using automated cars with other real subsystems to depict the surrounding environment, which are all controlled by the AI-core, and meanwhile the AI-core is always in the loop and learning from each and every executed test case and its results/outcomes. The main goal is to achieve efficient and high quality test and validation of systems for automated driving, which can save precious time in the development process. As a future scope of this methodology, we can step-up to make most parts of test and validation completely autonomous.","","978-1-5090-6435-9","10.1109/IntelliSys.2017.8324372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8324372","Machine Learning;Artificial Intelligence;AI-core;Autonomous Vehicles;ADAS systems;Test and Validation;Simulation;High quality;Efficient","Autonomous vehicles;Learning (artificial intelligence);Testing;Autonomous automobiles;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning","","48","3","26","IEEE","26 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of the research effort is to summarize computational tools, validation methodologies, and the corresponding fidelity levels delivered by state-of-the-art simulation toolchains. The ultimate goal is to establish how effectively simulation can play the role of a “virtual proving ground” for ADS certification independently from any specific ADS implementation/effectiveness. The contribution includes classic high-level validation approaches and modern specific computational tools that can be adopted depending on the type of data under analysis. Moreover, the investigation covers approaches embraced both within the scientific community and in technical regulations for the sake of completeness. Ultimately, we identified two high-level validation schema: integrated environment and subsystem-based solutions. In addition, we found that modeling and validating virtual sensors for ADS is the most lacking area from a subsystem-level approach.

The visual place recognition and loop-closure based re-localization techniques need to store a very large map and take a lot of time to re-localize the vehicle. We solve the problem by making a semantic map which is used to re-localize the vehicle, if and once it gets lost by conventional localization techniques. The semantic map is created using a test vehicle with sophisticated sensors, and the map can be used by any vehicle with a stereo camera for re-localization. It is assumed that the test vehicle has a budget stereo camera which produces numerous false positives to be rejected by the re-localizer; while the vehicle also misses many key landmarks during the run due to heavy traffic. These are the challenges which are overcome by the designed re-localization algorithm. The vehicle is tested on a highway scenario in Bengaluru, India for multiple runs in a highway segment.

Although many languages for high-level scenario modelling have been proposed, they lack the features to precisely and reliably control the required micro-simulation, while also supporting behavior reuse and test reproducibility for a wide range of interactive scenarios. To fill this gap between scenario design and execution, we propose the Simulated Driver-Vehicle (SDV) model to represent and simulate vehicles as dynamic entities with their behavior being constrained by scenario design and goals set by testers. The model combines driver and vehicle as a single entity. It is based on human-like driving and the mechanical limitations of real vehicles for realistic simulation. The model leverages behavior trees to express high-level behaviors in terms of lower-level maneuvers, affording multiple driving styles and reuse. Furthermore, optimization-based maneuver planners guide the simulated vehicles towards the desired behavior. Our extensive evaluation shows the model’s design effectiveness using NHTSA pre-crash scenarios, its motion realism in comparison to naturalistic urban traffic, and its scalability with traffic density. Finally, we show the applicability of our SDV model to test a real ADS and to identify crash scenarios, which are impractical to represent using predefined vehicle trajectories. The SDV model instances can be injected into existing simulation environments via co-simulation.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2024.3373531","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Renesas Electronics Corporation; Japan Science and Technology Agency Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO) Project HASUO Metamathematics for Systems; Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR) Ministero dell’universit‘a e della ricerca (MUR) Project VITALITY, Spoke 2 ASTRA–Advanced Space Technologies and Research Alliance(grant numbers:ECS00000041); PNRR MUR Project CHANGES, Spoke 5 Science and Technologies for Sustainable Diagnostics of Cultural Heritage(grant numbers:PE0000020); Progetti di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale (PRIN) Project-RoboChor: Robot Choreography(grant numbers:P2022RSW5W); PRIN Project-HALO: etHical-aware AdjustabLe autOnomous systems(grant numbers:2022JKA4SL); MUR (Italy) Department of Excellence 2023-2027 for Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI); Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) funded by Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Centre of Excellence on Connected, Geo-Localized and Cybersecure Vehicles (Excellence (EX)-Emerge), funded by Italian Government under Comitato Interministeriale per la Programmazione Economica (CIPE) Resolution(grant numbers:70/2017); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10485249","Intelligent vehicles;autonomous vehicles;autonomous driving;system testing;simulation;road traffic","Testing;Roads;Trajectory;Vehicles;Vehicle dynamics;Scalability;DSL","","3","","60","CCBY","28 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most of the current ADS testing methods generate test cases either from real traffic data or manually designed for some specific scenarios. There is little work on systematic methods to generate test cases from a complete map where an AV operates. Systematic testing on such a map is challenging due to the enormous scenarios. In this paper, we propose a collision-avoidance testing method for ADSs running on a map, which aims to reduce the scenario space while maintaining scenario diversity. The method consists of test case classification and test case generation. First, we build the topology structure of a map, based on which we classify possible scenarios into different classes. Second, we divide test cases into different classes using the topology-based scenario classification and fuzzy number-based motion evaluation. Third, we implement a bisection method to generate test cases that can efficiently expose ADSs' failures. We evaluate our method on one of the state-of-the-art ADSs, Baidu Apollo. The experiment results show that our method discovers Apollo's issues effectively while reducing the number of generated test cases by 77.36%, compared with the random method.","","978-1-7281-5394-0","10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575536","Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE)(grant numbers:19-C220-SMU-002); Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF)(grant numbers:NRF2018NCR-NCR005-0001,NRF2018NCR-NSOE003-0001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575536","","Geometry;Systematics;Roads;Web and internet services;Topology;Safety;Collision avoidance","","14","","32","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nowadays, human decision processes are supported by real-time data gathered from intelligent systems. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are one of the most used deep learning predictive models due to their outstanding computational capabilities. However, assessing their reliability is still an open issue faced by both the academic and industrial worlds, especially when ANNs are deployed on safety-critical systems, such as self-driving cars in the automotive world. In these systems, a strategy for identifying hardware faults is required by industry standards (e.g., ISO26262 for automotive, and DO254 for avionics). Among the existing in-field test strategies, the periodic scheduling of on-line Software Test Library (STL) is a wide strategy adopted; STL allows to reach an acceptable fault coverage without the need for additional hardware. However, when dealing with ANN-based applications, the execution of on-line tests interleaving the ANN inferences may jeopardise the strive for performance maximization. The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of six possible scenarios concerning the execution of on-line self-test programs in embedded devices running ANN-based applications. In the proposed scenarios, the impact of the STL execution on the ANN performance is analyzed; in particular, the execution times of an inference and the Fault Detection Time (FDT) of the STL are discussed and compared. Experimental analyses are provided by relying on: an open-source RISC-V platform running two different convolutional neural networks; a STL for RISC-V cores with a maximum achievable fault coverage of 90%.","1942-9401","978-1-6654-3370-9","10.1109/IOLTS52814.2021.9486704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9486704","Artificial Neural Networks applications;safety-critical application;Software-Test Library","Performance evaluation;Fault detection;Predictive models;Libraries;Hardware;Real-time systems;Tuning","","9","","26","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A scenario specifies conditions and events that an ADS is expected to respond to when deployed. Scenario specifications underpin the verification and validation (V&V) life-cycle, and are used by a diverse set of stakeholders - from engineers to regulators. Due to the diversity in stakeholder expertise, scenarios must be available at different levels of detail. Further, the chance of writing syntactically or semantically incorrect scenarios is high. Due to the high reliance of V&V on scenarios, their correctness is crucial. Therefore, present-day scenario-description languages (SDLs) need to be supported by technologies to help authors compose scenarios and provide a mechanism for easy translation into executable forms for virtual or real-life testing. This paper addresses these issues by building on the existing two-level abstraction WMG-SDL in the following ways, (1) introducing a human-readable, natural language SDL, replacing the former Level-1 SDL, and complementing the more detailed Level-2 SDL, which is now syntax aligned with the ODD Taxonomy defined in ISO 34503, and (2) providing a tool consisting of a parser and a validator to assist writing syntactically and semantically correct scenarios. Our tool may be used within a graphical scenario editing interface or on the command-line. Further, for developers, an object-oriented interface for parsed scenarios enables further development and integration with off-the-shelf ADS simulation and language tools.

Our approach SelfOracle is based on a novel concept of self-assessment oracle, which monitors the DNN confidence at runtime, to predict unsupported driving scenarios in advance. SelfOracle uses autoencoder- and time series-based anomaly detection to reconstruct the driving scenarios seen by the car, and to determine the confidence boundary between normal and unsupported conditions. In our empirical assessment, we evaluated the effectiveness of different variants of SelfOracle at predicting injected anomalous driving contexts, using DNN models and simulation environment from Udacity.

With current methodologies, it is difficult to address the various interactions between vehicle components and environmental factors. However, model-based engineering offers a solution by allowing to abstract reality and enhancing communication among engineers and stakeholders. Applying this method requires a model format that is machine-processable, human-understandable, and mathematically sound. In addition, the model format needs to support probabilistic reasoning to account for incomplete data and knowledge about a problem domain. We propose structural causal models as a suitable framework for addressing these demands.

However, assessing their dependability remains a critical concern. State-of-the-art ADS testing approaches modify the controllable attributes of a simulated driving environment until the ADS misbehaves. In such approaches, environment instances in which the ADS is successful are discarded, despite the possibility that they could contain hidden driving conditions in which the ADS may misbehave. In this paper, we present GenBo (GENerator of BOundary state pairs), a novel test generator for ADS testing.

This paper presents a self-fault diagnosis framework for CAV sensors with environmental impact quantification. We attribute the occurrence of abnormal sensor data patterns to four potential sources, i.e., the sensor itself, the external environment, the cyber-attack, and the measured object, and this paper emphasizes the former two. Specifically, a residual consistency checking algorithm based on the sensor redundancy is proposed to quickly detect and isolate the failed sensor, and the spectral entropy of each sensor data is calculated to assess their health status. Besides, measurement uncertainty is dynamically calculated to evaluate the measurement quality of the sensor system, and the environmental impact on the measuring process is then quantified.

However, in learning the representations for open-set diagnosis, the extracted representations lack hierarchy to preserve high-level and genuine representations, and the final representations utilized for diagnosing lack distinctiveness to separate unknowns from knowns. In addition, in the stage of testing, the open-set diagnosis models are error-prone when unknowns are similar to knowns. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a Multi-hop Attentive Graph Variational Autoencoder (MAGVA) model for open-set fault diagnosis in this paper. First, a multi-hop attentive graph convolutional network is developed to adaptively extract hierarchical representations and eliminate unknown fault misidentification. Then, to avoid unknown faults occupying the same region as known faults and identify known faults, structural representation constraints are designed by jointly conducting reconstruction with an intra-class constraint and classification with an inter-class constraint. Finally, combining the distinguishable representations learned by MAGVA, a generative distance-based open-set diagnosis algorithm is proposed, in which the procedures of estimating class-conditional distributions are designed, and a relative generative distance is then presented to derive diagnosis results under the class-conditional distributions. Experiments on three commonly used bearing datasets for vehicles demonstrate that the proposed MAGVA consistently outperforms the compared models in open-set, closed-set, and unknown fault diagnosis.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3300911","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2006202); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1808207); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(grant numbers:N2224001-7,N2116014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214203","Open-set fault diagnosis;multi-hop attentive graph variational autoencoder;structural representation constraints;generative distance-based diagnosis algorithm","Fault diagnosis;Training;Testing;Adaptation models;Classification algorithms;Autonomous vehicles;Mechatronics","","1","","43","IEEE","9 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the most efficient ways to validate the testing capabilities of a laboratory is the proficiency testing or interlaboratory comparison. In contrast to proficiency testing in EMC emission, which can be realized, for example, by using a comb generator with an antenna as test object, proficiency testing in EMC immunity is not very common today, mainly because there is no device that is specially designed for this purpose. In this contribution, we present a proficiency testing performed with a device that is specially developed to assess the field immunity testing capabilities of EMC laboratories according to IEC 61000-4-3. We also propose a method for the evaluation of this comparison.

VICTORY provides standard, on-the-wire network interfaces for C4ISR/EW and platform systems and sensors. VICTORY provides the ability to network platform equipment and enables automated testing and logistics data gathering, thereby offering key pieces of vehicle data to applications on the vehicle. The development of and adherence to open, well-defined, and accepted standards on military vehicles is key to an automated testing capability. By implementing open systems architectures (OSAs) as the interoperability layer upon which systems and sensors are connected, generalized test and evaluation methodologies can be developed and deployed. Leveraging modular, open system architectures and standard specifications like VICTORY for automated vehicle testing may provide opportunities for reduced system interconnect complexity, increased testing capabilities, and possibility for more meaningful, tightly coupled, data-rich test results.

In essence, simulation testing is a scenario-driven approach, whose effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality of given simulation scenarios. Moreover, simulation scenarios should be encoded into well-formatted files, otherwise, ADS simulation platforms cannot take them as inputs. Without large public datasets of simulation scenario files, both industry and academic applications of ADS simulation testing are hindered. To fill this gap, we propose a transformation-based approach SCTRANS to construct simulation scenario files, utilizing existing traffic scenario datasets (i.e., naturalistic movement of road users recorded on public roads) as data sources. Specifically, we try to transform existing traffic scenario recording files into simulation scenario files that are compatible with the most advanced ADS simulation platforms, and this task is formalized as a Model Transformation Problem. Following this idea, we construct a dataset consisting of over 1,900 diverse simulation scenarios, each of which can be directly used to test the state-of-the-art ADSs (i.e., Apollo and Autoware) via high-fidelity simulators (i.e., Carla and LGSVL). To further demonstrate the utility of our dataset, we showcase that it can boost the collision-finding capability of existing simulation-based ADS fuzzers, helping identify about seven times more unique ADS-involved collisions within the same time period. By analyzing these collisions at the code level, we identify nine safety-critical bugs of Apollo and Autoware, each of which can be stably exploited to cause vehicle crashes. Till now, four of them have been confirmed.","1558-1225","979-8-4007-0217-4","10.1145/3597503.3623350","National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2021YFB3101200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172105,62172104,62102091,62102093); Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China(grant numbers:TC220H079); Shanghai Rising-Star Program(grant numbers:210A1400700); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10548123","simulation scenario;autonomous driving;model transformation","Roads;Soft sensors;Computer bugs;Transforms;Safety;Recording;Task analysis","","1","","96","","14 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But existing testing methods are inadequate for checking the end-to-end behaviors of av controllers against complex, real-world corner cases involving interactions with multiple independent agents such as pedestrians and human-driven vehicles. While test-driving avs on streets and highways fails to capture many rare events, existing simulation-based testing methods mainly focus on simple scenarios and do not scale well for complex driving situations that require sophisticated awareness of the surroundings. To address these limitations, we propose a new fuzz testing technique, called AutoFuzz, which can leverage widely-used av simulators’ API grammars to generate semantically and temporally valid complex driving scenarios (sequences of scenes). To efficiently search for traffic violations-inducing scenarios in a large search space, we propose a constrained neural network (NN) evolutionary search method to optimize AutoFuzz. Evaluation of our prototype on one state-of-the-art learning-based controller, two rule-based controllers, and one industrial-grade controller in five scenarios shows that AutoFuzz efficiently finds hundreds of traffic violationsin high-fidelity simulation environments. For each scenario, AutoFuzz can find on average 10-39% more unique traffic violationsthan the best-performing baseline method. Further, fine-tuning the learning-based controller with the traffic violationsfound by AutoFuzz successfully reduced the traffic violationsfound in the new version of the av controller software.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3195640","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1845893,CCF-2107405,IIS-2221943,CCF-1815494); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific(grant numbers:N66001-21-C-4018); National Instruments Corporation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9847081","Search-based software engineering;evolutionary algorithms;neural networks;software testing;test generation;autonomous vehicles","Automobiles;Testing;Fuzzing;Vehicle crash testing;Grammar;Artificial neural networks;Roads","","28","","74","IEEE","1 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To effectively defend against adversaries, it is required to not only test autonomous cars for finding driving errors but to improve the robustness of the cars to these errors. To this end, in this paper, we propose a two-step methodology for autonomous cars that consists of (i) finding failure states in autonomous cars by training the adversarial driving agent, and (ii) improving the robustness of autonomous cars by retraining them with effective adversarial inputs. Our methodology supports testing autonomous cars in a multi-agent environment, where we train and compare adversarial car policy on two custom reward functions to test the driving control decision of autonomous cars. We run experiments in a vision-based high-fidelity urban driving simulated environment. Our results show that adversarial testing can be used for finding erroneous autonomous driving behavior, followed by adversarial training for improving the robustness of deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous driving policies.

Software integration and network connectivity inherit numerous security issues that open the door for malicious attacks. Software security testing is a scalable and practical approach to identify systems’ weaknesses and vulnerabilities at an early stage and throughout their life-cycle. Security specialists recommend fuzz testing to identify vulnerabilities within vehicle software systems. Nevertheless, the randomness and blindness of fuzzing hinder it from becoming a reliable security tool. This article presents a vulnerability-oriented fuzz (VulFuzz) testing framework that utilizes security vulnerability metrics designed particularly for connected and autonomous vehicles to direct and prioritize the fuzz testing toward the most vulnerable components. While most gray-box fuzzing techniques aim solely to expand code coverage, the proposed approach assigns weights to ensure a thorough examination of the most vulnerable components. Moreover, we employ an input structure-aware mutation technique that can bypass vehicle software systems’ input formats to boost test performance and avoid dropped test cases. Such a testing technique will contribute to the quality assurance of vehicle software engineering. We implemented the proposed approach on OpenPilot, a driver assistance system, and compared our results to American fuzzy lop (AFL) and an unguided mutation-based fuzzer. Within 16.8 h, VulFuzz exposed 335 crashes, 41 times more than AFL and two times more than an unguided mutation-based fuzzer. VulFuzz is explicitly efficient for automotive systems, reaching the same code coverage as AFL but with more exposed crashes and fewer dropped messages.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2021.3112538","Irdeto; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chairs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9557794","Autonomous systems security;autonomous system security testing;autonomous systems vulnerability;connected and autonomous vehicle;fuzz testing;gray-box testing;vehicle security","Security;Autonomous systems;Software systems;Industries;Fuzzing;Testing;Autonomous vehicles","","22","","75","IEEE","4 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Advanced technologies such as smart sensors, modern electronics, and computing algorithms are adopted in vehicle electrical and electronic (E/E) architectures. However, this leads to growing system complexity. The development process includes sensors finalization, integration, and validation against simulated dynamic environments. While progressing through the development process several key engineering challenges arise, thus the automotive industry is turning towards ‘modelling and simulation’ to overcome them at the early design stages. ADAS development is possible by balancing safety, comfort, and economical fuel efficiency with a simulation-based testing and validation framework. The simulation can be placed within a complete dynamic AV simulation loop, controlling the simulated environment.

Therefore, thoroughly testing them is paramount to avoid accidents and fatalities. Driving simulators allow developers to address this challenge by testing autonomous vehicles in many driving scenarios; nevertheless, systematically generating scenarios that effectively stress the software controlling the vehicles remains an open challenge. Recent work has shown that effective test cases can be derived from simulations of critical driving scenarios such as car crashes. Hence, generating those simulations is a stepping stone for thoroughly testing autonomous vehicles. Towards this end, we propose CRISCE (CRItical SketChEs), an approach that leverages image processing (e.g., contour analysis) to automatically generate simulations of critical driving scenarios from accident sketches. Preliminary results show that CRISCE is efficient and can generate accurate simulations; hence, it has the potential to support developers in effectively achieving high-quality autonomous vehicles.","2574-1926","978-1-6654-9598-1","10.1145/3510454.3528642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793783","testing;self driving cars;image analysis;scenarios synthesis","Image processing;Vehicle crash testing;Cyber-physical systems;Software;Task analysis;Autonomous vehicles;Stress","","1","","12","","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Methods to reduce data size, such as pruning and quantization are applied to reduce the memory footprint of DNNs and make it possible to accommodate them on resource-constrained edge devices. Recently, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been introduced with the purpose of understanding and explaining AI methods. XAI can be applied to understand the internal operations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including the significance of various neurons and features in shaping the overall performance of DNNs. In this paper, a novel DNN compression approach using XAI is proposed to efficiently reduce the DNN model size with negligible accuracy loss. In the proposed approach, the importance score of DNN parameters (i.e. weights) are computed using a gradient-based XAI technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Then, the scores are used to compress the DNN as follows: 1) the parameters with the negative or zero importance scores are pruned and removed from the model, 2) mixed-precision quantization is applied to quantize the weights with higher/lower score with higher/lower number of bits. The experimental results show that, the proposed compression approach reduces the model size by 64% while the accuracy is improved by 42% compared to the state-of-the-art XAI-based compression method.","2643-279X","979-8-3503-3015-1","10.1109/ICCKE60553.2023.10326237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10326237","Deep Neural Network;Compression;Explainable-AI","Performance evaluation;Knowledge engineering;Quantization (signal);Computational modeling;Neurons;Decision making;Artificial neural networks","","","","17","IEEE","27 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared with the typical environment for autonomous cars, the narrow and curving bus lane and the tight S-shape docking curves require a steering controller to consistently provide high accuracy with ride comfort. While analyzing the data of drivers steering through a double lane change course, we discovered and validated that driver's steering rate is proportional to a specific vehicle angle error. Subsequent analysis showed that drivers in effect execute a naturally robust controller that allows high-gain corrections and is insensitive to variations in vehicle dynamics and speeds. This paper presents the first adaptation of this driver's steering mechanism to a real-world challenging application. The resultant system achieved all performance requirements, and the revenue service at Eugene, OR, USA, started in June 2013. Moreover, the simple control structure greatly facilitated the design of fault detection, degraded control, and control redundancy.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2014.2331092","Vehicle Assist and Automation Project; Federal Transit Administration; Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office; California Department of Transportation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849477","Automated vehicle control;autonomous vehicles;bus rapid transit;driver models;intelligent vehicles;Automated vehicle control;autonomous vehicles;bus rapid transit;driver models;intelligent vehicles","Vehicles;Roads;Data models;Trajectory;Sensors;Vehicle dynamics;Analytical models","","28","1","23","IEEE","8 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Considering the non-stationary properties of real-time sensor faults and the mapping relationship between sensors and feature variables, the proposed method decomposes the sensor fault diagnosis analysis problem into an online data stream classification and feature ranking problems. To detect and identify faults, a clustering-based data stream classification approach is developed to continuously capture and classify non-stationary sensor faults for autonomous cars with little intervention from human experts. An effective active learning method is extended and embedded into the proposed framework to minimize the need for prior knowledge about faults and enable the continual learning capability to adapt to and handle the non-stationary properties of sensor faults. Moreover, the proposed framework addresses the parameter optimization issue of existing machine learning based fault analysis techniques and employs feature ranking analysis to systematically analyze the possible source(s) of sensor faults. CAR Learning to Act (CARLA), a well-known realistic autonomous driving simulator, is used as the benchmark to perform the sensor fault injection and online data stream collection to evaluate the efficacy of OLFA. Analysis of the collected faulty datasets and experimental results, and comparison between OLFA and several state-of-the-art clustering-based approaches for fault classification, demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed framework in the domain of autonomous cars.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3305620","Air Force Research Laboratory and the Office of the Secretary of Defense(grant numbers:FA8750-15-2-0116); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2000320); NASA University Leadership Initiative (ULI)(grant numbers:80NSSC20M0161); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10238359","Fault diagnosis analysis;autonomous cars;data stream classification;active learning;online learning","Automobiles;Fault diagnosis;Costs;Termination of employment;Data models;Analytical models;Mathematical models","","5","","62","IEEE","1 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A scenario describes situations that an automated driving systems may encounter during its operation. To ensure accurate representation of real-world situations, including human behavior and system interactions, a formal language is essential. It ensures consistent testing across diverse scenarios and facilitates compatibility with simulation tools. However, while existing scenario languages excel in describing environmental and road structure aspects, they lack the same detail for road users and drivers. We have developed a methodology to identify and incorporate relevant human factors elements into scenario languages. Our methodology focuses on understanding diverse individuals and their interactions with ADS on the road, enabling their representation in scenarios. We offer practical examples to improve language representation of human elements and actions, in WMG-SDL Level-2 for logical scenarios and BSI Flex 1889 for abstract scenario descriptions.

The proposed framework can activate each node by considering the logic when the application is run as a whole. In addition, input data specific to each node are required for node evaluation. Because each node exchanges various types of data, generating input data to evaluate a particular node can be difficult. Thus, the proposed framework generates input data suitable for node evaluation. The proposed framework also provides a graphical user interface (GUI). A developer can easily evaluate arbitrary nodes by manipulating the proposed framework on the GUI. Experimental results show that the proposed framework successfully activates the evaluation target node and evaluates arbitrary nodes of autonomous-driving software.

However, it is very difficult and challenging when the simulation results are unexpected. This work presents a simulation-based metamorphic testing (MT) approach to test the ADAS system, implementing the European new car assessment program (Euro NCAP) standards on OpenStreetMap (OSM). We first defined input patterns and relations related to autonomous driving, following the principles of MT. To assess the approach, we executed three tests in two steps at both the design and system levels. Our results show that none of the three (source) tests detected any collisions. However, for follow-up test cases, the ego vehicle failed to apply brakes to avoid a collision when the speed changed. A real-life issue in the system was immediately revealed and confirmed by the development team. We then designed a mechanism and continued the test to check whether the recorded collisions were avoidable. Our results (rate of 5.8%) indicate the fault detection effectiveness when testing the ADAS system. Although we applied the approach to testing the ADAS driving performance, it can be applied to other AD systems. This research, therefore, provides a systematic way to design and test autonomous driving technologies and integrate testing standards with metamorphic testing.","","979-8-3503-0176-2","10.1109/MET59151.2023.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10190426","Simulation testing;Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS);Metamorphic testing;Metamorphic relation pattern;Testing standards;OpenStreetMap","Systematics;Costs;Simulation;Fault detection;Europe;Safety;Standards","","","","45","IEEE","27 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed algorithm utilizes feedback gain adaptation, based on sensitivity estimation, and cost-based learning. Vehicle failure within this paper does not encompass every type of failure and refers only to any situation where the upper controller or communications from the upper controller shuts down. When this type of failure occurs, the algorithm performs an emergency pullover maneuver. This maneuver does not require any form of independent control from the driver to be performed successfully. However, the highest control priority is still given to the driver if the driver intervenes during the maneuver. The feedback gain adaptation is comprised of two sections: Sensitivity Estimation and Gradient Descent (GD) based Adaptation. For Sensitivity Estimation, a relationship function has been designed with feedback gain, from the feedback gain adaptation, and changes in state error. The sensitivity of state error with respect to feedback gain can then be estimated. This estimation is done through the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) method with multiple forgetting factors through the directional forgetting method. For GD based Adaptation, state errors are applied with parameters for the cost-based learning to give Adaptation Gains. These Adaptation Gains are used in tandem with the estimated sensitivity to update the feedback gain. To reduce the number of tuning parameters required in the GD method, an additional distance condition has been proposed. This condition utilizes feedback change rates and state errors, obtained from the multi-dimensional plane of the feedback gain’s change rates. A proportional coefficient is also required as a tuning parameter for this condition. This parameter is tuned by a cost-based learning algorithm, also designed in this study. Resultantly, these methods allow the adaptive feedback controller to forgo any system information such as mathematical models and system parameters. This indicates that the vehicle model is not expected to hinder performance. Hence, controllers that do not require system information are indeed a preferable algorithm for fail-safe modules. Performance evaluations for the controller has also been conducted with actual vehicle tests, under longitudinal and lateral autonomous driving scenarios.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3156275","Technology Innovation Program (Development and evaluation of automated driving systems for motorways and city roads) funded by the Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, South Korea(grant numbers:10079730); Technology Innovation Program (Development of AI-based autonomous computing modules and demonstration of services) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, South Korea(grant numbers:20005705); National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning (MSIP)(grant numbers:NRF2016R1E1A1A01943543); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9726148","Automated vehicle;fail-safe;autonomous driving;sensitivity estimation;cost-based learning;recursive least squares;forgetting factor;gradient descent (GD) method","Autonomous vehicles;Adaptation models;Safety;Vehicle dynamics;Sensitivity;Heuristic algorithms;Fault detection","","2","","59","CCBY","2 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its ability to extract patterns from a large set of data and then use this knowledge to make future predictions is beyond the human imagination. However, the complex calculations internally performed in them make these systems suffer from the oracle problem; thus, hard to test them for identifying bugs in them and enhancing their quality. An application not properly tested can have disastrous consequences in the production environment. Metamorphic Testing (MT) has been widely accepted by researchers to address the oracle problem in testing both supervised and unsupervised ML-based systems. However, MT has several limitations (when used for testing ML) that the existing literature lacks in capturing them in a centralized place. Applying MT to test ML-based critical systems without prior knowledge/understanding of those limitations can cost organizations a waste of time and resources. In this study, we highlight those limitations to help both the researchers and practitioners to be aware of them for better testing of ML applications. Our efforts result in making the following contributions in this paper, i) providing insights into various challenges faced in testing ML-based solutions, ii) highlighting a number of key challenges faced when applying MT to test ML applications, and iii) presenting the potential future research opportunities/directions for the research community to address them.","2835-3560","979-8-3503-3629-0","10.1109/AITest58265.2023.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10229487","Metamorphic Testing;Machine Learning;Metamorphic Testing for Machine Learning;Testing Machine Learning;Challenges in Testing Machine Learning;Applicability of Metamorphic Testing in Machine Learning;Challenges of Metamorphic Testing","Costs;Computer bugs;Transportation;Machine learning;Production;Organizations;Manufacturing","","1","","27","IEEE","29 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the widely adopted binary (pass/fail) criterion suffers from two main limitations, i.e., the difficulty of locating root causes and the lack of statistical guarantee of testing sufficiency. Recently, new scenario engineering approaches focusing on the intelligence of ADSs enlightened a promising pathway via dynamic driving task decomposition and function atom constraints. However, none of the state-of-the-art scenario description languages support such approaches.

Thorough tests are the keys to their successful deployment in real-world scenarios. However, real-world testing for ADS is usually expensive and hard to scale. Meanwhile, simulation-based testing has gained popularity due to its flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Unfortunately, there exist certain limitations in simulation-based testing. The inherent hardware uncertainty typically impacts the robustness of ADS in real-world contexts. Nevertheless, current approaches often neglect this crucial factor and assume the hardware is perfect. To bridge this gap, we initiate an early step and design a test pipeline for simulation-based testing with possible natural deviations. We validate the effectiveness of our testing pipeline on a multi-model ADS in 11 typical scenarios, each containing more than 60 deviations. Through experiments, we identify that both AI models and traditional software systems of ADS are not robust against natural deviation.","","979-8-3503-1956-9","10.1109/ISSREW60843.2023.00052","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; JST-Mirai Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10301326","Autonomous Driving;simulation-based testing;Physical deviation","Bridges;Uncertainty;Conferences;Pipelines;Software systems;Hardware;Robustness","","1","","35","IEEE","2 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, since creating detailed maps is a manual process, they are expensive, and testers should avoid wasting such valuable resources, for example, by generating irrelevant test cases. To address those issues, we propose SALVO a fully automated approach to identify quantifiably diverse and critical driving scenarios that can be instantiated on existing high-definition maps and implement them in an industrial driving simulator as executable test cases. The evaluation of SALVO in the context of the 2021 IEEE Autonomous Driving AI Test Challenge showed that it could analyze maps of different complexity and identify many critical driving scenarios in minutes.

However, there is generally no optimal set of weights, and different driving situations may require different weights values to guarantee a safe drive. Recent testing approaches can generate diverse driving scenarios in which different ADS configurations lead to various degrees of hazard. These tests need to be properly analyzed to improve the ADS's safety. In this paper, we propose an analysis approach that is able to assess the relation between the ADS configurations and the level of hazard that is obtained in some particular traffic situations. The approach uses fuzzification to partition ADS weights in different categories, and a spectrum-based analysis to identify which weights categories are related to hazard and safety. The occurrence of a hazard could be due to a single weight or to combinations of two or more weights. For scalability, the approach performs an incremental analysis, in which first single weights are considered, and then weight combinations of higher order.

Accelerated durability life testing is performed in a proving ground with a well defined set of damaging road events or `stressors' performed at a set of predefined speeds. A testing profile consisting of a mix of proving ground features is built. The objective of this profile is to closely match the total structural damage accumulated in test to the total damage due to `road load' accumulated by the automotive product over one design life, while also minimizing the total test time. In this paper we show that the problem of selecting a mix of proving ground features given calculated relative damage and time taken, is convex and hence solvable. Also, by fitting a continuous spline function to our field calculated damage values for 5 pre set velocities, we expand our convex optimization problem to include all possible velocities based on the sampling of the continuous function generated above. In the test profile developed, we were able to reach 9 out of 12 damage targets precisely over 2 design lives of the vehicle. This new test profile also takes approximately 175th the time of a similar testing profile derived manually. We then also develop three different testing profiles each with its own unique advantages.","","978-1-5090-0249-8","10.1109/RAMS.2016.7448027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448027","Convex Optimization;Rainflow Counting;Miners Rule;Relative Damage;Autonomous Vehicles","Testing;Optimization;Convex functions;Roads;Vehicles;Wheels;Splines (mathematics)","","","","6","IEEE","7 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fault diagnosis aims to provide essential information about the system operational status and its interpretation facilitates decision-making and mitigates the potential operation risks. In the present work, interpretability issue in fault diagnosis for autonomous vehicles is discussed from the sensor data analytics perspective. Environmental impact is first evaluated using the noise energy as a measure to interpret the impact on sensor data caused by the environment. A signal quality indicator is proposed and Savitzky–Golay filters are applied for online denoising, acting as a countermeasure to mitigate the impact and to enhance the data quality. Then, the adversarial learned denoising shrinkage autoencoder (ALDSAE), an adversarial learning neural network, is constructed for sensor data anomaly detection. It considers an adversarial training technique to improve the performance of the anomaly detector. A residual explainer specific to the ALDSAE model is employed to calculate the contribution of each input feature to the anomaly score in order to interpret the anomaly detection results. Several experiments with the collected data from an autonomous vehicle in a real test field are implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Results show that the area under the ROC curve (AUC_ROC) of the proposed ALDSAE is over 20% higher in average than several traditional anomaly detectors, and the mean explanation accuracy of the residual explainer achieves similar performance with the widely employed kernel Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) with more than 99% reduction in mean response time.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2023.3236838","National Key Research and Development Programs of China(grant numbers:2021YFB2501205); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61903046,52172325); Shaanxi Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2021GY-290); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2022JQ-663); Special Fund for Basic Scientific Research of Central Colleges(grant numbers:300102242103); Youth Talent Lift Project of Shaanxi Association for Science and Technology(grant numbers:20200106); China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10022031","Autonomous vehicles;environmental impact quantification;fault diagnosis;sensor data anomaly interpretation","Sensors;Anomaly detection;Autonomous vehicles;Fault diagnosis;Safety;Feature extraction;Noise measurement","","14","","52","IEEE","19 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One way to reduce this test load is virtual testing or hardware in-the-loop testing. The major challenge is to create realistic test cases that closely resemble the situation on the road. We present a way to use data of naturalistic driving to generate test cases for Monte-Carlo simulations of ADS. Because real-life data is used, the assessment allows to draw conclusions on how the ADS would perform in real traffic.

Most existing testing approaches consist in generating scenarios that vary the behaviors of dynamic objects, while leaving a predefined road environment unchanged. Consequently, these approaches overlook the influence of different road structures on ADS safety, e.g., collisions can happen more frequently than usual on a merging road, because of the specific road structure. In this paper, we propose EvoScenario, a novel approach that integrates road structures into the generation of critical scenarios for exposing safety risks of ADS. Specifically, EvoScenario models a driving road as a sequence of road segments characterized in different aspects, such as their shapes and widths. Then, a test case is defined by concatenating the sequence of road segments and the sequence of dynamic object maneuvers. Inspired by EvoSuite that generates sequential method calls for Java unit testing, EvoScenario leverages the sequential models of test cases and constructs a multi-objective optimization framework to search for critical scenarios. We implement and demonstrate EvoScenario on an ADS provided by our industrial partner. Evaluation results show that EvoScenario can identify 6 types of safety violations, and outperform existing baseline testing approaches.","2332-6549","979-8-3503-1594-3","10.1109/ISSRE59848.2023.00054","Anhui Provincial Department of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10301222","autonomous driving systems;search-based testing;safety violations","System testing;Java;Shape;Roads;Merging;Safety;Software reliability","","5","","64","IEEE","2 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our framework evaluates test cases against the STL formulae and additionally uses the requirements to automatically identify test cases that fail to satisfy the requirements. One of the key features of our tool is the support for machine learning (ML) components in the system design, such as deep neural networks. The framework allows evaluation of the control algorithms, including the ML components, and it also includes models of CCD camera, lidar, and radar sensors, as well as the vehicle environment. We use multiple methods to generate test cases, including covering arrays, which is an efficient method to search discrete variable spaces. The resulting test cases can be used to debug the controller design by identifying controller behaviors that do not satisfy requirements. The test cases can also enhance the testing phase of development by identifying critical corner cases that correspond to the limits of the system's allowed behaviors.

Simulations are especially useful when exposing the ADS to challenging driving scenarios, as they offer a safe and efficient alternative to real world testing. It is thus suggested that evidence for the safety case for an ADS will include results from both simulation and real-world testing. However, for simulation results to be trusted as part of the safety case of an ADS for its safety assurance, it is essential to prove that the simulation results are representative of the real world, thus validating the simulation platform itself. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for validating the simulation environments focusing on comparing point cloud data from real LiDAR sensor and a simulated LiDAR sensor model. A 3D object dissimilarity metric is proposed to compare between the two maps (real and simulated), to quantify how accurate the simulation is.

A 2x2 between-subjects design is chosen with two independent variables ‘prior information’ (extended/short) and ‘explanations’ (yes/no) with users pseudo-randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. Significant results from 189 test persons reveal, that trust depends on how the capabilities of the intelligent vehicle are explained a priori and not on situational explanations, while perceived intelligence is influenced by both variables. Additional interactions of prior information and user gender is noted with respect to perceived intelligence. As one side effect, it is found, that male users felt significantly more safe than female users with also higher ratings of intention to use the vehicle independently of given information and explanations. Another side effect is that situational explanations lead to better ratings of subjective performance, while also here a significant interaction of gender and prior information is noted. Thus, contrary to expectations, a dominant role of continuous situational explanations (Explainable AI) of the intelligent vehicle for increasing trust is not confirmed and the extent of given prior information seems the deciding factor for initial trust building, which is an important aspect for the introduction of new intelligent technology into society. This is remarkable as at the same time perceived intelligence seems to be dependent on both variables. So it appears, that a vehicle being able to explain its actions may well appear more intelligent, but not necessarily appear more trustworthy.","1944-9437","979-8-3503-3670-2","10.1109/RO-MAN57019.2023.10309319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10309319","","Simulation;Buildings;User experience;Safety;Artificial intelligence;Autonomous vehicles;Robots","","1","","21","IEEE","13 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As nowadays control-CPSs reaching millions of lines of source code, traditional human-flesh debugging is no longer sufficient. We need automated software fault localization (SFL) to assist the debugging. In automated SFL, automatically generated test cases are fed to the control-CPS (or the simulator of the control-CPS), to generate thousands of cyber-subsystem code traces and physical-subsystem trajectories. Next, another automated program, aka oracle, is needed to label the correctness of these physical-subsystem trajectories (and hence cyber-subsystem code traces), even without knowing if there is a bug in the cyber-subsystem. Control-CPS oracle design is a known hard problem. To our best knowledge, AR-SI oracle (denoted as AO in the following) is the most widely adopted control-CPS oracle so far. On the other hand, recently, transformer emerges as a major game changer in the domain of time series prediction. As AO is also time series prediction based, people naturally wonder if transformers can also be used as control-CPS oracles; and if so, can it outperform AO. In this paper, we answer this question by comparing AO with an intuitive design of transformer control-CPS oracle (simplified as TO in the following). Our comparison results show that in terms of SFL accuracy and latency, the TO does not significantly outperform the AO; in terms of false positive rate, the AO performs significantly better; and in terms of false negative rate, the TO performs significantly better.","2325-1301","979-8-3503-3786-0","10.1109/RTCSA58653.2023.00020","Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:BK20202001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:6223200862172200); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:020214380101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10296308","Software Fault Localization;control-CPS;transformer;Oracle","Location awareness;Codes;Source coding;Time series analysis;Computer bugs;Training data;Debugging","","","","26","IEEE","3 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, stealthy cyberattacks can remain undetected by the fault detection system and could cause catastrophic failure of the CPS. In this paper, we characterize the vulnerability of state estimation to such attacks and propose a cyberattack-resilient state estimation algorithm.

Explainable semantic segmentation (ESS) plays an essential role in building EADS, where it offers visual attention that helps the drivers to be aware of the ambient objects irrespective if they are roads, pedestrians, animals, or other objects. In this paper, we propose the first ESS model for EADS based on the variational autoencoder (VAE), and it uses the multiscale second-order derivatives between the latent space and the encoder layers to capture the curvatures of the neurons’ responses.

Our proposal disputes the above intuition by introducing an impossibility theorem that provably shows that all the safety testing algorithms of the aforementioned difference perform equally well with the same expected sampling efficiency. Moreover, for testing algorithms covering different sets of states and actions, the sampling efficiency criterion is no longer applicable as different algorithms do not necessarily converge to the same termination condition.

The reliable behavior of automated driving functions has to be proven by a testing process. While real-world testing is the evident method for verification, there are significant concerns regarding test scalability. Simulative methods are economical and safe alternatives to assess driving functions' quality. A catalog with scenarios recorded in real-world traffic for resimulation must be assembled, defining a set of requirements the driving function must pass before release. Therefore, to ensure safe behavior, the test catalog must include many diverse scenarios while reducing repetitive scenarios, as they do not pose additional challenges to the virtual vehicle and would unbalance the performance metrics. This work introduces a method to cluster and characterize vehicle behaviors based on trajectory data. The first step of the two-step bottom-up approach assigns individual coordinates of trajectories to clusters. Then, trajectory analysis is applied to histograms representing the distribution of retrieved cluster-IDs. Furthermore, we performed experiments, demonstrating the performance of our algorithm on various real-world data-sets. Using 1608 traffic scenarios, the method reduced the data-set by 61.0 %, eliminating redundant scenarios while upholding scenario space coverage. This algorithm serves as a basis for traffic scenario understanding to optimize test-set diversity.","","978-1-7281-9142-3","10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9564771","","Measurement;Histograms;Scalability;Conferences;Clustering algorithms;Trajectory;Safety","","5","","36","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, traditional decision-making systems have short-term characteristics, which makes them susceptible to real-time inference from surrounding vehicles. Usually, system sacrifices driving comfort to ensure the safety of the lane change. Balancing driving safety and comfort has always been a research challenge. Long-term trajectory prediction can provide accurate future trajectories of target vehicles, providing reliable long-term information to compensate for the short-term variability of decision systems. This paper proposes a novel decision-making model with long-term trajectory prediction for lane-changing. First, we constructed a long-term trajectory prediction model to predict the trajectories of surrounding vehicles. Besides, we built a lane change decision-making model based on fuzzy inferencing, considering the predicted trajectories to infer the relative relationship between other vehicles and the self-driving car. The establishment of the fuzzy rule library considered the vehicle speed, acceleration, system delay time, driver delay time and the distance between vehicles. Finally, we created a dataset for training and testing the trajectory prediction model, and we built 4 cases simulation environments, for two or three vehicles on a straight road or curved road, respectively, to test the decision-making model.

With the recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), automotive companies now employ blackbox AI models to enable vehicles to perceive their environment and make driving decisions with little or no input from a human. With the hope to deploy autonomous vehicles (AV) on a commercial scale, the acceptance of AV by society becomes paramount and may largely depend on their degree of transparency, trustworthiness, and compliance with regulations. The assessment of the compliance of AVs to these acceptance requirements can be facilitated through the provision of explanations for AVs’ behaviour. Explainability is therefore seen as an important requirement for AVs. AVs should be able to explain what they have ‘seen’, done, and might do in environments in which they operate. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work in explainable autonomous driving. First, we open by providing a motivation for explanations by highlighting the importance of transparency, accountability, and trust in AVs; and examining existing regulations and standards related to AVs. Second, we identify and categorise the different stakeholders involved in the development, use, and regulation of AVs and elicit their AV explanation requirements. Third, we provide a rigorous review of previous work on explanations for the different AV operations (i.e., perception, localisation, planning, vehicle control, and system management). Finally, we discuss pertinent challenges and provide recommendations including a conceptual framework for AV explainability. This survey aims to provide the fundamental knowledge required of researchers who are interested in explanation provisions in autonomous driving.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3122865","UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through the Project RoboTIPS: Developing Responsible Robots for the Digital Economy(grant numbers:EP/S005099/1); Assuring Autonomy International Programme [Demonstrator Project: Sense-Assess-eXplain (SAX)], a partnership between Lloyd’s Register Foundation and the University of York; Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Hub’s Project [Responsible AV Data (RoAD)](grant numbers:EP/V00784X/1); Responsible Technology Institute, Oxford; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9616449","Explanations;explainable AI;accountability;trust;autonomous vehicles;robotics;intelligent vehicles;human–machine interaction;regulations;standards","Autonomous vehicles;Stakeholders;Automation;Regulation;Artificial intelligence;Accidents;Standards","","115","","186","IEEE","16 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objective is for a group of agents (the diagnosers) to determine whether a plant has generated a faulty behavior or not, and this, a bounded number of steps after the fault occurred. The plant is modeled as a finite-state automaton producing sequences of events, over some alphabet. One or more special events model faults. Each diagnoser observes only a subset of events generated by the plant. The diagnosers can communicate their observations, which are delivered without loss and in order, but with all arbitrary delay. Diagnosability is a property of the plant with respect to one or more observable event sets, which ensures the existence of diagnosers. In the centralized case, diagnosability is known to be decidable (in polynomial time). We show that the decentralized fault diagnosis problem is undecidable for two or more diagnosers. We also show that the problem is undecidable for three or more diagnosers, even in the case where the language produced by the plant is prefix-closed.

Therefore, fault diagnosis is crucial for maintaining stable operations. The massive amounts of complex multidimensional data generated during AUV operations make it challenging to construct rule bases efficiently. The extended belief rule base (EBRB) offers a solution by employing data-driven approaches. Furthermore, as the data are sequentially generated, online training is more aligned with the practical realities of AUV operations. When processing large amounts of data, the EBRB system generates a substantial number of rules. This process can be very time-consuming. It may trigger the activation of many irrelevant rules, potentially leading to erroneous decisions. In response, a fault diagnosis method for autonomous underwater vehicles based on an online extended belief rule base with dynamic rule reduction (OEBRB-R) is introduced in this paper. This approach involves first establishing an OEBRB model that continually processes new incoming sensor data in real time. Subsequently, it employs a Mahalanobis distance-based k-means clustering technique to dynamically reduce the number of active rules. Finally, evidence reasoning (ER) algorithms are utilized to infer the type of fault present. Through case studies, the proposed method has been empirically validated for maintaining strong accuracy in real-time diagnostics while effectively reducing the model’s spatial complexity.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3487841","Teaching Reform Project of Higher Education in Heilongjiang Province(grant numbers:SJGY2021045); Social Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province(grant numbers:21GLC189); Foreign Expert Projects in Heilongjiang Province(grant numbers:GZ20220131); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2023QF010); Social Science Planning Foundation of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:L23BTQ005); Scientific Research Project of Liaoning Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:JYTMS20230555); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10737308","Fault diagnosis;extended belief rule base;rule reduction;autonomous underwater vehicle;online model updating","Fault diagnosis;Real-time systems;Data models;Vehicle dynamics;Accuracy;Cognition;Autonomous underwater vehicles;Uncertainty;Fault detection;Solid modeling","","","","43","CCBYNCND","29 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the huge amount of data being processed as well as the lack of complete specifications, the testing of code search engines faces the oracle problem. Metamorphic testing (MT) is a well-known testing technique that is effective for alleviating the oracle problem. In this paper, we propose to apply MT to test code search engines. We first identify five metamorphic relations (MRs) by considering the characteristics of code search engines. Four MRs are defined based on the partial specifications of code search engines and thus are used for the purpose of verification, and the one MR identified from the users' perspective can be used to conduct validation. The approach is evaluated by conducting a series of experiments involving four popular code search engines (namely, Krugle, searchcode, sourcegraph and Zoekt), and one well-known code repository (namely, GitHub) that provides the code search services. The experimental results show that the abnormal behaviors of Krugle, searchcode, GitHub, and Zoekt have been successfully detected. By further inspecting the root causes of these abnormal behaviors, three critical issues related with the code search engines under investigation are identified and reported. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and are also helpful for the users and developers to gain a deeper understanding about the code search engines.","","978-1-7281-4086-5","10.1109/TASE49443.2020.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9405312","Metamorphic testing;code search engine;metamorphic relation","Search engines;Software;Faces;Testing;Software development management;Software engineering","","","","20","IEEE","22 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CounterFactual (CF) explanations have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting the behaviour of black-box DNNs. A CF explainer identifies the minimum modifications in the input that would alter the model's output to its complement. In other words, it computes the minimum modifications required to cross the model's decision boundary. Current deep generative CF models often work with user-selected features rather than focusing on the discriminative features of the black-box model. Consequently, such CF examples may not necessarily lie near the decision boundary, thereby contradicting the definition of CFs. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel approach that leverages saliency maps to generate more informative CF explanations. Our approach guides a Generative Adversarial Network based on the most influential features of the input of the black-box model to produce CFs near the decision boundary. We evaluate the performance using a real-world dataset of driving scenes, BDD100k, and demonstrate its superiority over several baseline methods in terms of well-known CF metrics, including proximity, sparsity and validity. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve the interpretability of DNNs and provides a promising direction for generating more accurate and informative CF explanations.

Especially, the impacts of their functional faults and incompatible external conditions are often difficult to identify. To address this issue, this article presents a simulation-aided approach as follows: 1) A simulation-aided operational data generation service with the operational parameters extracted from the corresponding system models and specifications; 2) A Fault Injection (FI) service aimed at high-dimensional sensor data to evaluate the robustness and residual risks of LEC. 3) A Variational Bayesian (VB) method for encoding the collected operational data and supporting an effective estimation of the likelihood of operational conditions. As a case study, the paper presents the results of one experiment, where the behaviour of an Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system is simulated under various weather conditions based on the CARLA driving simulator. A set of fault types of cameras, including solid occlusion, water drop, salt and pepper, are modelled and injected into the perception module of the AEB system in different weather conditions. The results indicate that our framework enables to identify the critical faults under various operational conditions.

To address this, it is crucial to comprehensively cover a range of possible conditions in simulators and identify risk scenarios within the system, which poses a significant high-dimensional search problem. To efficiently, accurately, and comprehensively generate diverse risk scenarios, we propose a scenario evaluation model. This model can learn the distribution of risk factors from a limited number of scenario samples and provide pre-evaluation to guide the generation process. The experimental results show that that our method can generate an average of 40.6% more risk scenarios compared to other generation methods, while also requiring 63.6% fewer simulations. The method based on the scenario evaluation model can effectively improve efficiency, accuracy, and the identification of more risk scenarios, thus providing a more thorough evaluation of the safety performance of autonomous driving systems.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-8867-9","10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10191164","","Deep learning;Neural networks;Closed box;Search problems;Robustness;Entropy;Safety","","","","32","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to this megatrend, new automotive test tracks appear or older ones transform to be capable of testing and proving for autonomous vehicles. Therefore, the question emerges: what are the key areas for automated drive development, which must be financed in case of autonomous proving ground design? It is a real challenge to be able to make the right decisions due to a lack of numerous experiences in this field. In this research, experts of automated driving technology have been surveyed and their opinion and knowledge have been synthesized. As a strong purpose of gaining robust results, the conventional AHP has been amended by the Pareto approach to ensure that the derived weights correspond to the expert scoring intention so perfectly that it cannot be more improved. Since the non-Pareto optimal weight results might cause rank reversal in the final prioritization, the applied Pareto test guarantees that the final outcome reflects the expert evaluators' incentive. The conducted analysis has indicated that the obtained results are robust not only from the sensitivity point of view but also from the Pareto optimality approach. The proposed hierarchical decision model is therefore applicable to assist decision making for autonomous proving ground developments.

Tech companies and automotive manufacturers use the idea of Operational Design Domain (ODD) to indicate where their Automated Driving Systems (ADS) can operate safely. By definition from SAE J3016, an ODD defines where the ADS is designed to operate. However, it is loosely defined in no particular format, and it is unclear how exactly to formulate the ODD, which leaves it up to the ADS developer to determine. This paper proposes a methodology to identify an ODD for an ADS with statistical data and risk tolerance, where the identified ODD is constituted of a geographical map where the risk of ADS operation is lower than the pre-determined risk threshold for a given set of environmental conditions. Two different ADSs are run through this method as an example to showcase the methodology and link the identified ODD directly to the calculated performance of the ADSs. This systematically generated ODD can mitigate potential safety issues by informing the limitations of the ADS to safety drivers, through geographic and environmental boundaries.","2642-7214","978-1-7281-6673-5","10.1109/IV47402.2020.9304552","Huawei's Noah's Ark Lab; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9304552","Autonomous vehicles;vehicle safety;operational design domain (ODD)","Safety;Roads;Vehicles;Generators;Testing;Business;Autonomous vehicles","","23","","30","IEEE","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While existing testing approaches primarily aim at the criticality of scenarios, they often overlook the diversity of the generated scenarios that is also important to reflect system defects in different aspects. To bridge the gap, we propose LeGEND, that features a top-down fashion of scenario generation: it starts with abstract functional scenarios, and then steps downwards to logical and concrete scenarios, such that scenario diversity can be controlled at the functional level. However, unlike logical scenarios that can be formally described, functional scenarios are often documented in natural languages (e.g., accident reports) and thus cannot be precisely parsed and processed by computers. To tackle that issue, LeGEND leverages the recent advances of large language models (LLMs) to transform textual functional scenarios to formal logical scenarios. To mitigate the distraction of useless information in functional scenario description, we devise a two-phase transformation that features the use of an intermediate language; consequently, we adopt two LLMs in LeGEND, one for extracting information from functional scenarios, the other for converting the extracted information to formal logical scenarios. We experimentally evaluate LeGEND on Apollo, an industry-grade ADS from Baidu. Evaluation results show that LeGEND can effectively identify critical scenarios, and compared to baseline approaches, LeGEND exhibits evident superiority in diversity of generated scenarios. Moreover, we also demonstrate the advantages of our two-phase transformation framework, and the accuracy of the adopted LLMs.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering → Software testing and debugging; Search-based software engineering.","2643-1572","979-8-4007-1248-7","","Anhui Provincial Department of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10764952","Autonomous Driving Systems;Critical Scenario Generation;Large Language Models","Software testing;Large language models;Web and internet services;Transforms;Feature extraction;Software;Scenario generation;Data mining;Autonomous vehicles;Software engineering","","","","50","","29 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Metamorphic testing has shown great potential to alleviate the test oracle problem by exploiting the relations among the inputs and outputs of different executions of the system, so-called metamorphic relations (MRs). In this article, we propose an MR pattern called PV for the identification of performance-driven MRs, and we show its applicability in two CPSs from different domains, which are automated navigation systems and elevator control systems. For the evaluation, we assessed the effectiveness of this approach for detecting failures in an open-source simulation-based autonomous navigation system, as well as in an industrial case study from the elevation domain. We derive concrete MRs based on the PV pattern for both case studies, and we evaluate their effectiveness with seeded faults.

The need for powerful steering control in autonomous vehicles is critical for assuring the vehicle’s safety and reliability. Robust steering control allows for precise and accurate maneuvering, allowing the vehicle to traverse complicated road conditions. Comparative research on the certification of a robust steering system for autonomous vehicles is presented in this paper. Traditional controllers (PD and PID) are compared with a modern Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller that uses a multi-turn potentiometer and incremental encoder for position feedback. The controllers are designed in MATLAB Simulink and deployed for real-time testing on a Speedgoat performance real-time target Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) machine. The study focuses on evaluating the steering system’s real-time performance in terms of accuracy and robustness. The novelty is that this work is carried out in a real experimental modified electric vehicle and presents real-time results obtained using the HIL machine and Rapid Control Prototyping (RCP) technique. The research covers a thorough examination of the experimental hardware configuration, system identification, controller design, and data-gathering technologies. A significant contribution of this research is the use of the HIL machine for real-time performance testing of different controllers with different velocities and sample times, specifically in a speed breaker scenario. To analyze each controller’s response, real-time data is logged at a high sampling rate of 0.1 milliseconds. The research contributes to the advancement of driverless vehicles by providing insights into the optimal performance of steering systems. It also emphasizes the importance of real-time testing of the robust performance of different controllers to ensure human safety in driverless cars.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3406219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10539991","Steering system;autonomous vehicle;model predictive control (MPC);rapid control prototyping (RCP);hardware-in-the-loop (HIL);robust control","Autonomous vehicles;Real-time systems;Steering systems;Roads;Automobiles;Potentiometers;Safety;Predictive control;Hardware-in-the-loop simulation;Robust control","","1","","30","CCBYNCND","27 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The hybrid simulation creates a bi-directional integration, meaning that, in the 3D simulator, the ego-vehicle sees and interacts with the rest of the vehicles, and at the same time, in the traffic simulator, all additional vehicles detect and react to the actions of the ego-vehicle. Two interfaces, one for each simulator, where created to achieve the integration, they ensure the synchronization of the scenario, the state of all vehicles including the ego-vehicle, and the time.

We propose an online image sensor fault detection method based on comparing the historical variances of normal pixels and defective pixels to detect faults. For fault pixels without uncertainty, with a detecting window of more than 30 frames, we get 100% accuracy and 100% recall on realistic continuous traffic pictures from the KITTI data set. We also explore the influence of fault pixel values' uncertainty from 0% to 25% and study different fixed thresholds and a dynamic threshold for judgments. Strict threshold, which is 0.1, has a high accuracy (99.16%) but has a low recall (34.46%) for 15% uncertainty. Loose threshold, which is 0.3, has a relatively high recall (83.78%) but mistakes too many normal pixels with 18.17% accuracy for 15% uncertainty. Our dynamic threshold balances the accuracy and recall. It gets 100% accuracy and 58.69% recall for 5% uncertainty and 78.38% accuracy and 55.39% recall for 15% uncertainty.

The proposed method combines scenario exploration and generation and starts with an initial scenario set, allowing for the use of any random scenario. Through the mechanisms of mu-tation, crossover, and selection inherent in EAs, a diverse range of new scenarios is generated until the criticality metrics indicate that certain scenarios meet the predefined criteria, prompting the termination of the EA process.

With the advent of connected and autonomous vehicles, there will be a period of time when some vehicles on the road are automated (either partially or fully), and others are still driven by humans. Therefore, there is a dire need for a model that can be used in conjunction with sensors in autonomous vehicles, to detect and predict if a human-driven vehicle will turn into the incorrect destination lane. This research makes use of two Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) arterial street data sets in order to perform a comparative analysis of drivers' destination lane choice behavior, specifically for left turns. The model accurately predicts when drivers choose lane 1 as their destination lane and performs poorly when predicting lanes 2 or 3 as their destination lane.

In this talk, I will report our recent studies on testing and debugging path-planning software with our industry partner. Our approach is to adapt techniques originally for software programs to work with the path-planning software driven by optimization and weight design. Specifically, we use search-based (optimization-driven) testing and repair techniques as well as fault localization techniques to detect, explain, and fix “significant” crash cases. I will also discuss future directions from the perspective of “systems of systems”.","","978-1-7281-7735-9","10.1109/ISSREW51248.2020.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9307712","","Testing;Software;Internet of Things;Autonomous vehicles;Security;Optimization;Informatics","","","","","IEEE","4 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The importance weights of scenario elements are determined by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and the effect transmission model.

We tackle this challenging and rarely addressed problem with a vision system that leverages appearance, contextual as well as geometric cues. To utilize the appearance and contextual cues, we propose a new deep learning-based obstacle detection framework. Here a variant of a fully convolutional network is proposed to predict a pixel-wise semantic labeling of (i) free-space, (ii) on-road unexpected obstacles, and (iii) background. The geometric cues are exploited using a state-of-the-art detection approach that predicts obstacles from stereo input images via model-based statistical hypothesis tests. We present a principled Bayesian framework to fuse the semantic and stereo-based detection results. The mid-level Stixel representation is used to describe obstacles in a flexible, compact and robust manner. We evaluate our new obstacle detection system on the Lost and Found dataset, which includes very challenging scenes with obstacles of only 5 cm height. Overall, we report a major improvement over the state-of-the-art, with a performance gain of 27.4%. In particular, we achieve a detection rate of over 90% for distances of up to 50 m. Our system operates at 22 Hz on our self-driving platform.","","978-1-5090-4804-5","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995849","","Roads;Semantics;Machine learning;Labeling;Three-dimensional displays;Autonomous automobiles;Hazards","","92","1","30","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This failure may lead to damage in one or more of the autonomous vehicles. Model-based health monitoring of a network of vehicles requires knowledge of a model of the system and the excitation signal, and thus may not be applicable.

This paper presents an approach to integrating Explainable AI (XAI) methods with YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to provide interpretability of its predictions in real-time autonomous driving environments. We focus on implementing various Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods, such as Grad-CAM and HiResCAM, as well as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to create an explanation framework. We also combine CAM and LRP to make use of the strengths of both methods, improving the overall explainability. This method achieves good performance, running object detection at 50 to 60 frames per second (FPS) on a standard dedicated GPU, and around 24 FPS when running alongside the explainability models. Furthermore, this approach maintains a high detection accuracy, due to its post hoc nature, making sure that the XAI implementations do not affect the model’s detection performance. Our experimental results shows that the combined XAI approach not only preserves the high detection accuracy of YOLOv8 but also provides more meaningful visual explanations using the XAI methods, showing that this integrated XAI methods could improve the trustworthiness and safety of AI-driven systems in autonomous vehicles and other possible fields.","","979-8-3503-5348-8","10.1109/ICAMAC62387.2024.10829286","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10829286","YOLOv8;Explainable AI (XAI);Object Detection;Autonomous Driving;Class Activation Mapping (CAM);Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP)","Visualization;Accuracy;Explainable AI;Decision making;Focusing;Object detection;Predictive models;Real-time systems;Safety;Autonomous vehicles","","","","10","IEEE","9 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These test procedures are described, for example, in the New Car Assessment Programme test catalog, which only considers a limited number of possible scenarios. Furthermore, pedestrian targets are, among others, used to test assistance systems for protection against vulnerable road users (VRUs). However, these targets also have the disadvantage that they only represent humans in a simplified way and cannot depict realistic movement patterns. On the other hand, simulation has been established as an efficient means of realizing scenarios in a reproducible, time- and cost-saving manner. However, simulation has a major disadvantage: it can only represent reality to a limited extent, e.g., in the influence of human factors in response to hazardous situations. To bridge the gap between simulation and real-world testing, we introduce MiRE, a mixed reality environment for testing automated driving functions. In MiRE, real entities meet in a virtual environment and take advantage of real and simulated test procedures. This paper presents MiRE, a proof of concept based on a modular architecture. The goal is to use it to evaluate the feasibility of testing in mixed reality – by comparing it to proving ground testing. Preliminary results show that MiRE is a suitable environment for testing complex scenarios where the real vehicle and VRUs can safely interact in safety-critical situations and produce realistic results.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3160353","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(grant numbers:13FH7I01IA (SAFIR IP1),13FH7I06IA (SAFIR IP6),13FH578IX6 (MUViT)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9737417","Human factors;road vehicle testing;vehicle safety;virtual reality","Testing;Sensors;Virtual environments;Data models;Standards;Solid modeling;Mixed reality","","15","","58","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our proposed method is based upon cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGANs) trained by a small set of image samples to mathematically map a nominal case to other corner cases.

DNNs can have multiple misclassification types, and so neurons responsible for one type could be different from those responsible for another type. However, depending on the granularity of the analyzed dataset, FL may not reveal these differences: failure types more frequent in the dataset may mask less frequent ones. We here propose a way to perform FL for DNNs that avoids this masking effect by selecting test data in a granular way. We conduct an empirical study, using a spectrum-based FL approach for DNNs, to assess how FL results change by changing the granularity of the analyzed test data. Namely, we perform FL by using test data with two different granularities: following a state-of-the-art approach that considers all misclassifications for a given class together, and the proposed fine-grained approach. Results show that FL should be done for each misclassification, such that practitioners have a more detailed analysis of the DNN faults and can make a more informed decision on what to fix in the DNN.","2332-6549","978-1-6654-2587-2","10.1109/ISSRE52982.2021.00037","JST; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9700265","deep neural networks;fault localization;granularity;misclassification","Location awareness;Deep learning;Fault diagnosis;Neurons;Software reliability;Biological neural networks","","5","","53","IEEE","11 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Metamorphic relation composition can reduce the cost of metamorphic testing. However, its effectiveness has found mixed answers. This paper reports the preliminary results of our study on measuring the cost-effectiveness of composite metamor-phic relations for testing DL systems.

Numerous studies have been conducted in this area to help newcomer vehicles plan their trajectory and velocity. However, most of these proposals only consider trajectory planning using conjunction with a limited data set (i.e., metropolis areas, highways, and residential areas) or assume fully connected and automated vehicle environment. Moreover, these approaches are not explainable and lack trust regarding the contributions of the participating vehicles. To tackle these problems, we design an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning model to improve the effectiveness and trustworthiness of the trajectory decisions for newcomer Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). When a newcomer AV seeks help for trajectory planning, the edge server launches a federated learning process to train the trajectory and velocity prediction model in a distributed collaborative fashion among participating AVs. One essential challenge in this approach is AVs selection, i.e., how to select the appropriate AVs that should participate in the federated learning process. For this purpose, XAI is first used to compute the contribution of each feature contributed by each vehicle to the overall solution. This helps us compute the trust value for each AV in the model. Then, a trust-based deep reinforcement learning model is put forward to make the selection decisions. Experiments using a real-life dataset show that our solution achieves better performance than benchmark solutions (i.e., Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Random Selection (RS)).","2376-6506","978-1-6654-6749-0","10.1109/IWCMC55113.2022.9824617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9824617","Trajectory Planning;Autonomous Vehicles Selection;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Federated Learning;Edge Computing;Trust;Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Training;Wireless communication;Trajectory planning;Computational modeling;Transportation;Reinforcement learning;Collaborative work","","16","","30","IEEE","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There will be a phase where autonomous vehicles will have to take part with the human driven vehicles. In this phase autonomous vehicle and vehicle drivers must be careful in driving maneuvers, since it is impossible to just have autonomous vehicles on the road while the transition to fully autonomous driving takes place. To make the system more reliable and robust, authors feel that it must be substantially improved and to achieve this 3 methodologies have been proposed. The use cases are derived from the camera placed in the suitable positions of every vehicle. This creates several use cases with different driving behaviors, which truly reflects the conditions which the autonomous car needs to undergo in series. Authors propose several architectures to address the safety related issues. Since, the number of use cases are so random that it becomes practically impossible to manage data, so we propose to have a secured cloud storage. The cloud provides a secure and reliable data management system to the machine learning algorithm computation. The data management till now is effectively done via trained unique use cases. This make a big data which is encapsulation of different unique use cases under different driving conditions. So we conclude that the usage of ML and cloud based data management is the way forward for handling autonomous vehicle reliably. This may not be the complete solution, but nevertheless we are one step closer towards 2025. This concept can be implemented only in co-operation of the OEMs and Public authorities.","","978-1-5386-2787-7","10.1109/ICCE-ASIA.2017.8309326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8309326","","Computer architecture;Safety;Autonomous vehicles;Cloud computing;Reliability;Vehicle crash testing","","1","","15","IEEE","8 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, they fail to provide human-interpretable information on the cause of the challenge which is critical information for the efficient selection of relevant test scenarios. Therefore, this paper presents the Challenge Description Method that mitigates this issue by analyzing scenarios and providing a description of their challenge in terms of the minimum required lane changes and their difficulty.

However, most commercially available LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) systems are expensive and computationally intensive. This research characterizes an inexpensive 2D LIDAR system using the LIDAR-Lite v1 for use in obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles. Since data acquisition occurs only in a single plane, the system should be computationally fast. The field of vision should be capable of up to 360 degrees. The data acquired was median-filtered and pre-processed by the merging and segmentation of data points. Obstacle detection was then performed via clustering.

Our paper presents an empirical testing of AV simulator system that combines the SVL simulator and the Apollo platform. We propose 576 test cases which are inspired by four naturalistic driving situations with pedestrians and surrounding cars. We found that the SVL can imitate realistic safe and collision situations; and at the same time, Apollo can drive the car quite safely. On the other hand, we noted that the system failed to detect pedestrians or vehicles on the road in three out of four classes, accounting for 10.0% total number of scenarios tested. We further applied metamorphic testing to identify inconsistencies in the system with additional 486 test cases. We then discussed some insights into the scenarios that may cause hazardous situations in real life. In summary, this paper provides a new empirical evidence to strengthen the assertion that the simulator-based system can be an indispensable tool for a comprehensive testing of the AV.","","978-1-6654-3481-2","10.1109/AITEST52744.2021.00031","ARC(grant numbers:DP210102447); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9564102","autonomous vehicles;SVL simulator;Apollo;metamorphic testing","Roads;Conferences;Tools;Safety;Automobiles;Artificial intelligence;Autonomous vehicles","","13","","10","IEEE","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An open question is how to simulate rare events, not necessarily found in autonomous driving datasets or scripted simulations, but which can occur in testing, and, in the end may lead to severe pedestrian related accidents. This paper presents a method for designing a suicidal pedestrian agent within the CARLA simulator, enabling the automatic generation of traffic scenarios for testing safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dangerous situations with pedestrians. The pedestrian is modeled as a reinforcement learning (RL) agent with two custom reward functions that allow the agent to either arbitrarily or with high velocity to collide with the AV. Instead of significantly constraining the initial locations and the pedestrian behavior, we allow the pedestrian and autonomous car to be placed anywhere in the environment and the pedestrian to roam freely to generate diverse scenarios. To assess the performance of the suicidal pedestrian and the target vehicle during testing, we propose three collision-oriented evaluation metrics. Experimental results involving two state-of-the-art autonomous driving algorithms trained end-to-end with imitation learning from sensor data demonstrate the effectiveness of the suicidal pedestrian in identifying decision errors made by autonomous vehicles controlled by the algorithms.","2153-0017","979-8-3503-9946-2","10.1109/ITSC57777.2023.10422034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10422034","","Measurement;Pedestrians;Reinforcement learning;Safety;Reliability;Autonomous vehicles;Testing","","","","27","IEEE","13 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, several uni- and multivariate metrics are applied towards a scoring of similarity of the behavior between simulation and real test drive. This is achieved by using ground truth data in form of simulation scenarios from real world measurement data. In this way, the virtual automated vehicle encounters the same conditions and surroundings than its counterpart in the real world for evaluating their similarity. The practical applicability of the proposed credibility assessment approach is demonstrated in a case study, in which the credibility of an exemplary simulation-based test bench is inferred.","2687-7813","","10.1109/OJITS.2022.3140493","AUDI AG; German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure within the Automated and Connected Driving funding program(grant numbers:01MM20012A (SAVeNoW)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9669987","Automated driving;software-in-the-loop;scenario-based approach;virtual testing;virtual development;virtual validation;computer simulation;automotive engineering;intelligent vehicles;automated vehicles","Intelligent vehicles;Data models;Standards;Road traffic;Computational modeling;Vehicle dynamics;Autonomous vehicles;Automotive engineering","","22","","46","CCBY","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, the presence of noise corrupts sensors' ideal performance, causing detection and state estimation of moving objects to be erroneous. These detection errors propagate through the overall system and potentially compromise the reliability and safety of the AV. To get an assurance that the vehicle will operate safely, any simulation platform for an AV must include a realistic representation of the fallacies in vehicle's perception. In this study, the perception error for a vision based detection algorithm of the camera sensor is modeled by applying auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) and nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) method. It will enable statistical error values to be injected into ideal values obtained from simulation models. The proposed approach is evaluated based on several test case scenarios using various environmental and traffic information. A comparative analysis of the behavior of the AV with and without perception error model for the imperfection of camera sensor has been undertaken using the CarMaker platform. The investigation of the impact on the behavior of the AV by the variation of the state (distance, brake-torque) clearly depict the effectiveness of incorporating the error model at detection level in CarMaker.","2153-0017","978-1-7281-0323-5","10.1109/ITSC.2018.8570015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8570015","Autonomous Vehicle;Auto-regressive Moving Average;Bounding box offset;CarMaker;Error modeling;Perception error;Sensor imperfection","Sensors;Data models;Time series analysis;Cameras;Analytical models;Predictive models;Testing","","8","1","20","IEEE","9 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the witness of many safety issues has raised a big concern about the reliability of AVs. To solve this problem, much research has been done to test deep learning-driven AVs. Generally, once a test input is produced, a developer needs to manually check its expected output. However, there often exists massive unlabeled test data (e.g., raw context traces in the real world). It is impractical to manually label all test inputs. Despite some works on automatic generation of test oracles, they are either task-specific or constrained to synthetic inputs. In this paper, we present a general and extensible framework, DeepSuite, to mitigate the manual effort of generating test oracles. The intuition behind is that not all test inputs are equally worth labelling. With limited testing budget, it is desirable to label a test suite with high diversity and a reasonable size. Due to the large search space, to optimize such test suites is of great challenge. To address it, DeepSuite employs a three-phase optimization method (i.e., selection, crossover, and mutation) to iteratively select representative but non-redundant test suites. Such conflicting profit/cost objectives are attained through a genetic algorithm with a well-defined multi-objective fitness function. In the experiments, we first show that the diversity of tests can be revealed by test criteria. Then, experiments on three widely-used datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of DeepSuite in generating test suites with competitive testing coverage and 68.42% smaller size, which greatly improves the data collection efficiency of testing DL-driven autonomous vehicles.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3131808","National Key Project of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1005700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102197,62002178); NSFC-General Technology Joint Fund for Basic Research(grant numbers:U1936206); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin, China(grant numbers:20JCQNJC01730); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9646479","Autonomous vehicles;data collection;deep learning testing;genetic algorithm;test suite optimization","Testing;Autonomous vehicles;Neurons;Deep learning;Labeling;Fuzzing;Statistics","","2","","34","IEEE","10 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Manual annotation of these datasets is expensive and requires a vast number of man-hours, making it unsuitable for large scale training and validation. These limitations highlight the need for exploiting automatic annotation in simulators. This work presents a framework for synthetic dataset generation for Lidar sensors with the same Lidar sensors setup of the Waymo ego vehicle used to generate the real-world Waymo-Open Dataset. The framework generates synthetic dataset with the exact format of the well-known Waymo-Open Dataset. In addition, this paper releases a new synthetic dataset named Cairo University-Carla Waymo (CUCW) dataset for Lidar sensors using the framework introduced in this paper. This dataset can be used to aid in training and validating deep learning models used in the advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS). The framework uses the CARLA urban simulator which is one of the best-suited urban simulators for end-to-end testing of the unique functionalities that self-driving cars offer, including perception, mapping, localization, and vehicle control. The generated dataset is compared against both Waymo-Open and KITTI-CARLA datasets. The framework is made publicly available.

Fairness testing thus targets the prediction phase in ML, not the learning phase. In this paper, we investigate fairness for the learning phase. Our definition of fairness is based on the idea that the learner should treat all data in the training set equally, disregarding issues like names or orderings of features or orderings of data instances. We term this property balanced data usage. We consequently develop a (metamorphic) testing approach called TiLe for checking balanced data usage.

This paper introduced Finite State Machine (FSM) to complement the STPA for its weakness in analyzing high-level autonomous vehicles with multiple automated modes and functions. Firstly, previous applications of STPA to ADAS and ADS and their limitations are analyzed. Secondly, the hazardous event is defined. An extended method combining STPA and FSM is proposed to model the vehicle states and environmental conditions and analyze unexpected behaviors. Finally, a case study on an autonomous vehicle is given to compare the traditional STPA and the extended method.

First, existing schemes cannot continually test all traffic scenarios in the time domain such as future unknown scenarios and the scenarios with the degraded performance of the AVs. Second, it is an open issue that quantifies safety and explains the relationships between safety testing and proof, especially how safe is enough and why tests can transform into a certain level under the safety proof scale. To address these challenges, we propose a fuzzing digital twin approach, DT-FT, to construct a provable safety scheme for AVs.

For the selection of “good” test cases, the literature has proposed search-based techniques that are guided by optimization goals in the form of fitness functions. Existing works focus on technical aspects or create such fitness functions ad-hoc, leaving the methodological aspect of deriving suitable fitness functions unconsidered. There are suggestions regarding methodological guidance in the form of fitness function templates, but these ideas have so far been exclusively instantiated for straight sections on a highway. The methodological challenge of how to derive fitness functions for other road contexts, e.g. intersections scenario types, has not been tackled yet.

Specifically, the framework combines a frequency global filter block (FGF-Block) with a Transformer, which is able to capture the global contextual information of the entire feature instead of only local information. By virtue of this integration, the proposed framework can better extract fault feature information in noisy environments and exhibit excellent diagnostic accuracy. We experimentally validate the FGF-Trans method on the AUVs fault dataset. Experimental results show it has higher application potential and accuracy in actual scenarios than traditional deep learning models.","","979-8-3503-0135-9","10.1109/PHM-Hangzhou58797.2023.10482519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10482519","Autonomous underwater vehicles;Fault diagnosis;Transformer;Fast Fourier Transform","Fault diagnosis;Deep learning;Autonomous underwater vehicles;Frequency-domain analysis;Noise;Transformers;Feature extraction","","","","14","IEEE","15 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It follows by a further testing on the suspected weak scenarios and statistically evaluate the model's performance on the scenarios to confirm the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis of weak scenarios is confirmed by test results, the treatment of the model is performed by retraining the model using a transfer learning technique with the original model as the base and applying a set of training data specifically targeting the treated scenarios plus a subset of training data selected at random from the original train dataset to prevent the so-call catastrophic forgetting effect. Finally, after the treatment, the model is assessed and evaluated again by testing on the treated scenarios as well as other scenarios to check if the treatment is effective and no side-effect caused. The paper reports a case study with a real ML deep neural network (DNN) model, which is the perception system of an autonomous racing car.

Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) provides a way to search for the most-likely failure scenario as a Markov decision process (MDP). Our previous work used a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solver to identify likely failure scenarios. However, the solver's use of a feed-forward neural network with a discretized space of possible initial conditions poses two major problems. First, the system is not treated as a black box, in that it requires analyzing the internal state of the system, which leads to considerable implementation complexities. Second, in order to simulate realistic settings, a new instance of the solver needs to be run for each initial condition. Running a new solver for each initial condition not only significantly increases the computational complexity, but also disregards the underlying relationship between similar initial conditions. We provide a solution to both problems by employing a recurrent neural network that takes a set of initial conditions from a continuous space as input. This approach enables robust and efficient detection of failures because the solution generalizes across the entire space of initial conditions. By simulating an instance where an autonomous car drives while a pedestrian is crossing a road, we demonstrate the solver is now capable of finding solutions for problems that would have previously been intractable.","","978-1-5386-7024-8","10.1109/ITSC.2019.8917403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8917403","","Testing;Stress;Recurrent neural networks;Autonomous vehicles;Trajectory;Machine learning;Markov processes","","24","","19","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rather than focus on a particular component of the AV, like adaptive cruise control, the toolchain models the end-to-end dynamics of the AV in a formal way suitable for testing and verification. First, a domain-specific language capable of describing the scenarios that occur in the day-to-day operation of an AV is defined. The language allows the description and composition of traffic participants (e.g., other vehicles and traffic control devices), and the specification of formal correctness requirements. A scenario described in this language is an executable that can be processed by a specification-guided automated test generator (bug hunting), and by an exhaustive reachability tool. The toolchain allows the user to exploit and integrate the strengths of both testing and reachability, in a way not possible when each is run alone. Finally, given a particular execution of the scenario that violates the requirements, a visualization tool can display this counter-example and generate labeled sensor data. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on three autonomous driving scenarios drawn from a collection of 36 scenarios that account for over 95% of accidents nationwide. These case studies demonstrate robustness-guided verification heuristics to reduce analysis time, counterexample visualization for identifying controller bugs in both the discrete decision logic and low-level analog (continuous) dynamics, and identification of modeling errors (e.g., traffic behaviors) that lead to unrealistic environment behavior.","","978-1-5090-6055-9","10.1109/RWEEK.2017.8088654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8088654","","Roads;Tools;Testing;Robustness;Safety;Trajectory;Autonomous vehicles","","18","1","23","IEEE","30 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent fatalities, however, have emphasized the importance of safety validation through large-scale testing. Multiple approaches achieve this fully automatically using high-fidelity simulators, i.e., by generating diverse driving scenarios and evaluating autonomous driving systems (ADSs) against different test oracles. While effective at finding violations, these approaches do not identify the decisions and actions that caused them-information that is critical for improving the safety of ADSs. To address this challenge, we propose ACAV, an automated framework designed to conduct causality analyses for AV accident recordings in two stages. First, we apply feature extraction schemas based on the messages exchanged between ADS modules, and use a weighted voting method to discard frames of the recording unrelated to the accident. Second, we use safety specifications to identify safety-critical frames and deduce causal events by applying CAT-our causal analysis tool-to a station-time graph. We evaluated ACAV on the Apollo ADS, finding that it can identify five distinct types of causal events in 93.64% of 110 accident recordings generated by an AV testing engine. We further evaluated ACAV on 1206 accident recordings collected from versions of Apollo injected with specific faults, finding that it can correctly identify causal events in 96.44% of the accidents triggered by prediction errors, and 85.73% of the accidents triggered by planning errors.","1558-1225","979-8-4007-0217-4","10.1145/3597503.3639175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10548641","Autonomous driving system;test reduction;causality","Fault diagnosis;Web and internet services;Cause effect analysis;Recording;Safety;Software reliability;Autonomous vehicles","","1","","64","CCBY","14 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In-process feedback has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing HMI in autonomous vehicles, but limited research exists on its effectiveness. The purpose of this study is to determine how effective in-process feedback is at enhancing HMI. To investigate the impact of in-process feedback on HMI, a within-subjects approach and a quasi-experimental design were used. Ninety participants with experience driving autonomous vehicles were recruited and divided into an investigational group receiving in-process feedback and a control group without such feedback. The study measured the efficacy of in-process feedback on HMIs through subjective and objective measures. The subjective measure utilized a questionnaire to assess participants' perceptions of their driving experience, including comfort, confidence, and trust in the autonomous vehicle. The objective measure analyzed participants' driving behavior, encompassing speed, lane keeping, and steering patterns. The experimental group outperformed the control group in terms of comfort, confidence, and trust in the driverless car, according to the results. The objective measure also indicated improved driving behavior in the investigational group, including smoother lane keeping and fewer instances of sudden braking and acceleration. In conclusion, this study supports the effectiveness of in-process feedback as an approach to enhancing HMI in autonomous vehicles. The findings have practical implications for the design and development of autonomous vehicle technology, ultimately contributing to the public's acceptance and adoption of this technology.","","979-8-3503-1006-1","10.1109/AIC57670.2023.10263851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10263851","Human-machine interaction (HMI);Autonomous vehicles;In-process feedback;Efficacy;Quasi-experimental design","Human computer interaction;Accelerometers;Atmospheric measurements;Roads;Particle measurements;Behavioral sciences;Autonomous automobiles","","","","20","IEEE","2 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Behind the wheels of these mobile robots lies machine learning (ML) to automate mundane driving tasks and make decisions from situational awareness. Attacking ML, the brain of driverless cars, can cause catastrophes. This paper proposes a novel approach to attack CAV by fooling its ML model. Using adversarial examples in CAVs, the work demonstrates how adversarial machine learning can generate attacks hardly detectable by current ML classifiers for CAV misbehavior detection. First, adversarial datasets are generated by a traditional attack engine, which CAV misbehavior detection ML models can easily detect. Building attack ML model takes two phases: training and testing. Using supervised learning, Phase I trains the model on the time-series data, converted from the adversarial datasets. Phase II tests the model, which leads, for the next round of model improvement. The initial round deploys K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, respectively. The next round, guided by deep learning (DL) models, uses Logistic Regression (LG) of neural network and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) of recurrent neural network.

Is a more significant number of sampled scenarios guaranteeing a more accurate safety assessment of the ADS? Despite the various empirical success of ADS safety evaluation with scenario sampling in practice, some of the fundamental properties are largely unknown. This paper seeks to remedy this gap by formulating and tackling the scenario sampling safety assurance problem from a set invariance perspective. First, a novel conceptual equivalence is drawn between the scenario sampling safety assurance problem and the data-driven robustly controlled forward invariant set validation and quantification problem. This paper then provides a series of complete solutions with finite-sampling analyses for the safety validation problem that authenticates a given ODD. On the other hand, the quantification problem escalates the validation challenge and starts looking for a safe sub-domain of a particular property. This inspires various algorithms that are provably probabilistic incomplete, probabilistic complete but sub-optimal, and asymptotically optimal. Finally, the proposed asymptotically optimal scenario sampling safety quantification algorithm is also empirically demonstrated through simulation experiments.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2021.3117049","U.S. Department of Transportation(grant numbers:69A3552047138); CARMEN University Transportation Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9556594","Safety;scenario sampling;invariant set;automated driving system","Safety;Testing;Probabilistic logic;Sampling methods;Reachability analysis;Lead;Intelligent vehicles","","14","","36","IEEE","1 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, with the increased functionality of automated driving systems (ADSs) and the expansion of the operational designed domain (ODD), the number of scenario elements that need to be tested has rapidly increased, leading to an explosion of concrete scenarios to be tested. Accordingly, the accelerated test methods targeting the enhanced generation of hazardous concrete scenarios have become the main trend of AV tests. However, existing methods mainly adopt serial processing, which cannot provide multi-threaded parallelism. This paper proposes a distributed accelerated concurrency testing (ACT) method for ADS, which combines an accelerated test method with traditional concurrent testing. The test frame is divided into three layers: a top-layer manager, middle-layer scheduler, and bottom-layer executor. Then, the specific tasks of roles at different layers are determined; for instance, the coverage of a middle-layer scheduler and the test parameters of a bottom-layer executor. In addition, the modified Ackley function is used for preliminary verification of the effectiveness of the proposed test method. Finally, a black-box AV algorithm is tested in the front vehicle cut-in scenario in a virtual environment using the proposed ACT method, traversal concurrency testing method, accelerated serial testing method, and traversal serial testing method. The test results show that the proposed ACT method can effectively find dangerous concrete scenarios in the logical scenario parameter space and reduce the testing time significantly compared to the other three methods.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2023.3295366","Chinese National Science Foundation(grant numbers:U22A20247,52172386); Department of Science and Technology of Jilin Province(grant numbers:20220201023GX,20220301009GX); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10187704","Automated vehicle;scenario-based test;accelerated test;parallelism test;particle swarm algorithm","Testing;Life estimation;Concurrent computing;Computer architecture;Parallel processing;Heuristic algorithms;Remotely guided vehicles;Particle swarm optimization","","1","","30","IEEE","19 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The CTFL program aims at ensuring that all certified testers have a common understanding of software testing - independent of the product domain. So far, more than 500,000 testers worldwide passed the CTFL certification.However, each product domain has specific characteristics and constraints that must be considered when qualifying testers for that domain. This applies especially to the automotive domain, which has international and national regulations, standards, and technologies. These have a high impact on automotive software testing. Additionally, with the introduction of electric, connected and autonomous vehicles, the amount of software in the car is rising significantly. The ISTQB is introducing an add-on qualification to the CTFL for the automotive domain: the CTFL Specialist Automotive Software Tester (CTFL-AuT).

At present, research relies on sampling the driving behaviour of Surrounding Vehicles (SV) based on naturalistic datasets in simulation. However, these methods still generate huge amounts of scenarios, making it impossible to synthetically evaluate AV intelligence in a very small number of tests (especially in real-world situations). Simultaneously, the unknown distribution of critical scenarios leads to the problem that more critical scenarios cannot be accurately sampled. In this article, a novel optimization problem is described and a dynamic scenario sampling method is proposed to cover more critical scenarios with finite samples. First, the sampling space is constructed by extracting the behavioural model parameters of the SVs. Second, multiple rounds of sampling are carried out successively to learn the distribution of critical scenarios, which in turn gradually improves the coverage of the critical scenarios. To do this, in each round, we divide the sampling space into several subspaces using two-step sampling, sample the scenarios using Random Quasi Monte Carlo (RQMC), evaluate the criticality of the subspace, and then use the evaluation results to guide the selection of the sampling space for the next round. The purpose of RQMC is to uniformly sample in the critical subspace rather than Standard Monte Carlo (SMC). Experimental results show that our method can better narrow the gap with the distribution of critical scenarios and discover more critical scenarios when compared to the baseline method.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2024.3358329","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB2501200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10415067","Autonomous vehicles;intelligence testing;multi-rounds testing;random quasi Monte Carlo","Testing;Behavioral sciences;Monte Carlo methods;Sampling methods;Vehicle dynamics;Autonomous vehicles;Automation","","3","","70","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Software security testing aims to minimize the attack surface of CAVs by identifying security vulnerabilities at an early stage. One of the most robust and efficient security testing methods is fuzzing. Though fuzz testing can validate the system with various scenarios, its blindness prevents it from exploring the deep paths of the system. Hence, the automotive industry needs a reliable security testing tool that dynamically explores the system and assures a comprehensive evaluation. This paper presents a hybrid fuzz testing framework (VulFuzz++) that unites the efficiency of fuzzing and the precision of concolic execution to provide the automotive industry a reliable security testing tool. VulFuzz++ offloads most of the exploration process to the vulnerability-oriented fuzzer (VulFuzz) explicitly designed for automotive systems. When the fuzzer halts failing to explore different paths, VulFuzz++ examines the untraversed branches and prioritizes them based on their potential to expose vulnerabilities. It utilizes a tailored, targeted concolic engine that limits the symbolic exploration to only specific functions. When the concolic engine discovers new system inputs, testing is handed over again to the fuzzer to perform a quick and efficient evaluation of the newly explored region. We implemented and experimented with the VulfFuzz++ framework on a driving assistance system. VulFuzz++ boosted the vulnerability exposure process of grey-box fuzzing, increasing the obtained crashes by 50%. It dramatically outperforms traditional concolic engines in assisting fuzzers, exposing 50 times more unique crashes. VulFuzz++ extends the testing time moderately but assures a comprehensive examination covering 96.7% of the automotive system branches.","2693-9371","978-1-6654-7836-6","10.1109/QRS-C55045.2021.00080","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Research Chairs (CRC) program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9742036","automotive security testing;fuzz testing;symbolic execution;concolic testing","Industries;Software quality;Fuzzing;Software reliability;Security;Autonomous vehicles;Engines","","2","","37","IEEE","1 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We leverage this information and develop a technique for generating corner case scenarios that exercise diverse geographical features such as curves and slopes. Our approach first generates the ego-vehicle’s driving routes so that they achieve full lane coverage on the entire map, then clusters those routes by geographical features, and constructs driving scenarios by adding other objects and environments. In our experiments on Autoware-Universe, we evaluate our technique with six high-definition maps from the Carla simulator.

Many approaches have been proposed to adaptively generate testing scenarios during the testing process. However, most existing approaches cannot be applied to complex scenarios, where the variables needed to define such scenarios are high dimensional. Towards filling this gap, the adaptive testing with sparse control variates method is proposed in this paper. Instead of adaptively generating testing scenarios, our approach evaluates CAVs' performances by adaptively utilizing the testing results. Specifically, each testing result is adjusted using multiple linear regression techniques based on control variates. As the regression coefficients can be adaptively optimized for the CAV under test, using the adjusted results can reduce the estimation variance, compared with using the testing results directly. To overcome the high dimensionality challenge, sparse control variates are utilized only for the critical variables of testing scenarios. To validate the proposed method, the high-dimensional overtaking scenarios are investigated, and the results demonstrate that our approach can further accelerate the evaluation process by about 30 times.","","978-1-6654-6880-0","10.1109/ITSC55140.2022.9922583","National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2021YFB2501200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62133002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9922583","Adaptive testing;connected and automated vehicles;sparse control variates;overtaking scenarios","Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Linear regression;Estimation;Filling;Safety;Intelligent transportation systems","","3","","23","IEEE","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This situation is particularly challenging when seeking to provide assurance in critical AI systems (CAIS) where the underlying algorithms may be very difficult to verify under any conditions. In these cases using systems that have a similar underlying application, operational profiles, user characteristics, and underlying AI algorithms may be suitable as testing proxies. For example, a robot vacuum may have significant operational and implementation similarities to act as a testing proxy for some aspects of an autonomous vehicle.In this work we discuss the challenges in assured autonomy for CAIS and suggest a way forward using proxy systems.

We investigate the influences of sensor cover contaminations on the output data, i.e., on the lidar point cloud and full waveform. Different contamination types were applied (dew, dirt, artificial dirt, foam, water, and oil) and the influence on the output data of the single beam lidar RIEGL LD05-A20 and the automotive mechanically spinning lidar Ouster OS1-64 was evaluated. The LD05-A20 measurements show that dew, artificial dirt, and foam lead to unwanted reflections at the sensor cover. Dew, artificial dirt over the entire transmitter, and foam measurements lead to severe faults, i.e., complete sensor blindness. The OS1-64 measurements also show that dew can lead to almost complete sensor blindness.

These simulations help developers to validate the algorithms, test various dangerous edge-case scenarios, increase the speed at which the problems can be solved, reduce high costs by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), etc. One such emerging technology is connected vehicles (CVs) which enable communication with neighboring vehicles and road infrastructure. This paper presents ‘CARLA Connect’, a Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) driving simulator framework. For this, we have used CARLA, an open-source Autonomous Vehicle (AV) only driving simulator framework, and extended it to support AV, CV, and CAV features. CARLA Connect allows continuous development and testing of CV and CAV algorithms to visually validate them in real-time simulation. First, we developed two custom sensors needed in CV technology, a connectivity agent that supports both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, and modular CV and CAV agents which contain the algorithms. These developed sensors and agents can now be used by developers to create and test their own scenarios. Using CARLA Connect, we have developed and validated six V2V CV algorithms, three V2I CV algorithms, and two V2V CAV algorithms. CARLA provides a pygame window where warnings can be displayed on the screen, simulating a human-machine interface (HMI). We use this to visually verify the warnings given to the driver and validate the underlying algorithms.","","979-8-3503-9922-6","10.1109/iSES54909.2022.00146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10027084","Connected Vehicles (CVs);Autonomous Vehicles (AVs);Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs);Simulation;CARLA","Connected vehicles;Costs;Vehicle-to-infrastructure;Roads;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Real-time systems;Sensors","","4","","12","IEEE","2 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In previous studies, to evaluate maneuver challenge of a scenario, surrogate models (SMs) are often used without explicit knowledge of the CAV under test. However, performance dissimilarities between the SM and the CAV under test usually exist, and it can lead to the generation of suboptimal scenario libraries. In this article, an adaptive testing scenario library generation (ATSLG) method is proposed to solve this problem. A customized testing scenario library for a specific CAV model is generated through an adaptive process. To compensate for the performance dissimilarities and leverage each test of the CAV, Bayesian optimization techniques are applied with classification-based Gaussian Process Regression and a newly designed acquisition function. Comparing with a pre-determined library, a CAV can be tested and evaluated in a more efficient manner with the customized library.

Like humans detect those abnormal situations and take counter-measures to prevent collisions, self-driving cars need anomaly detection mechanisms. However, the literature lacks a standard benchmark for the comparison of anomaly detection algorithms. We fill the gap and propose the R-U-MAAD benchmark for unsupervised anomaly detection in multi-agent trajectories. The goal is to learn a representation of the normal driving from the training sequences without labels, and afterwards detect anomalies. We use the Argoverse Motion Forecasting dataset for the training and propose a test dataset of 160 sequences with human-annotated anomalies in urban environments. To this end we combine a replay of real-world trajectories and scene-dependent abnormal driving in the simulation. In our experiments we compare 11 baselines including linear models, deep auto-encoders and one-class classification models using standard anomaly detection metrics. The deep reconstruction and end-to-end one-class methods show promising results.

Can we expect increase of the road safety with self-driving cars? Who will take responsibility for what happened if a road accident occurs? The answers to such questions must be provided before the popularization of autonomous vehicles. The problems around self-driving cars, such as “co-operation of machine control to driver's operation”, “safety on roads” and “reliability of automation technologies in self-driving cars”, should be solved. Therefore, the relationship between human driver, or responsible person of driving, and automatic operation is the key point.

The proposed scheme deploys observation test points that capture the faulty effects in every shift cycle into separate observation scan chains. To reduce area overhead, the scheme enables the sharing of flip-flops among control points. It is also shown how test points enhance test coverage (TC) in the presence of cascaded clock gaters.

In this paper, we preliminarily design and evaluate a declarative Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)-based metamorphic testing framework BMT, which enables domain experts to specify custom traffic behaviors—a car shall decelerate by x% when a bicycle is in front, etc. It then automatically translates a human-written behavior to a corresponding metamorphic relation and synthesizes meaningful test inputs using a variety of image and graphics processing techniques. Our preliminary evaluation shows that BMT can detect a significant number of erroneous predictions of three driving models for speed predictions. These detected erroneous predictions are manually examined and confirmed by six human judges as meaningful traffic violations. By automating test generation from custom behaviors, BMT enables experts to easily express domain-specific constraints and finds violations of such constraints.","","978-1-6654-4464-4","10.1109/MET52542.2021.00012","Australian Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9477683","Metamorphic Testing;Autonomous Driving;Deep Learning Models;Software Testing and Verification","Graphics;Conferences;Neural networks;Bicycles;Predictive models;Test pattern generators;Automobiles","","11","","30","IEEE","12 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By transforming a normal sample with some carefully crafted human imperceptible perturbations, even highly accurate DNN make wrong decisions. Multiple defense mechanisms have been proposed which aim to hinder the generation of such adversarial samples. However, a recent work show that most of them are ineffective. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to detect adversarial samples at runtime. Our main observation is that adversarial samples are much more sensitive than normal samples if we impose random mutations on the DNN. We thus first propose a measure of 'sensitivity' and show empirically that normal samples and adversarial samples have distinguishable sensitivity. We then integrate statistical hypothesis testing and model mutation testing to check whether an input sample is likely to be normal or adversarial at runtime by measuring its sensitivity. We evaluated our approach on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. The results show that our approach detects adversarial samples generated by state-of-the-art attacking methods efficiently and accurately.","1558-1225","978-1-7281-0869-8","10.1109/ICSE.2019.00126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812047","adversarial sample;detection;deep neural network;mutation testing;sensitivity","Testing;Perturbation methods;Sensitivity;Runtime;Training;Biological neural networks","","123","1","56","IEEE","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the downside of using deep neural networks to learn control policies is their opaque nature and the difficulties of validating their safety. As the networks used to obtain state-of-the-art results become increasingly deep and complex, the rules they have learned and how they operate become more challenging to understand. This presents an issue, since in safety-critical applications the safety of the control policy must be ensured to a high confidence level. In this paper, we propose an automated black box testing framework based on adversarial reinforcement learning. The technique uses an adversarial agent, whose goal is to degrade the performance of the target model under test. We test the approach on an autonomous vehicle problem, by training an adversarial reinforcement learning agent, which aims to cause a deep neural network-driven autonomous vehicle to collide. Two neural networks trained for autonomous driving are compared, and the results from the testing are used to compare the robustness of their learned control policies. We show that the proposed framework is able to find weaknesses in both control policies that were not evident during online testing and therefore, demonstrate a significant benefit over manual testing methods.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9197351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197351","","Testing;Autonomous vehicles;Training;Learning (artificial intelligence);Machine learning;Robots;Robustness","","28","","47","IEEE","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For educators, teaching such a vast and dynamic field is both a necessity and a challenge. IoT-relevant topics such as programming, hardware, networking and artificial intelligence are already covered in core computing curricula. Does this mean that fresh graduates are well prepared to tackle complex IoT problems? Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. The problem is that IoT devices are complex systems, where software, hardware, and humans interact with each other. From this interaction, unique behavior and hazardous situations can emerge that might easily stay undetected, unless systems are analyzed as a whole. This paper presents two differently flavored courses that teach IoT using a holistic, system-centric approach. The first is a broad introduction to Pervasive Computing, focused on the intelligence of ""Things"". The second is an advanced course that zooms on the process of testing a software-intensive system. The key characteristics of our approach are : (1) teaching only the bare essentials (topics needed for end-to-end engineering of a smart system), (2) a strong, hands-on project component, using microcontroller-based miniature systems, inspired by real-life, and (3) a rich partnership with industry and academic idea incubators. Positive student evaluations gathered during the last five years demonstrate that such an approach brings engagement, self-confidence and realism in IoT classrooms. We believe that this success can be replicated in other courses, by shifting the focus on different IoT-relevant aspects.","","978-1-7281-1000-4","10.1109/ICSE-SEET.2019.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8802112","computer science education;pervasive computing;software testing;software engineering;systems engineering;microcontrollers;embedded systems;robotic kits;autonomous vehicles;insulin pump;academia industry cooperation;safety critical systems","","","19","","37","IEEE","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, that an autonomous vehicle does not crash or that intelligent credit scoring system is not biased, even after passing substantial acceptance testing prior to release. In this paper we discuss AI trust and assurance and related concepts, that is, assured autonomy, particularly for critical systems.

In this paper we present an actual driving study we conducted the last year, in which we analyze the effect of an head-mounted-display on the situation awareness and telepresence of the remote driver during teleoperation in narrow city scenarios. The user trial focuses on the benefits of a head-mounted display compared to conventional computer screens for visualizing the camera and sensor data. The results indicate that state of the art head-mounted displays allow a higher feeling of immersion, but do not necessarily improve the driving performance of the operator and controllability of the vehicle since collisions with test objects still occur.

We applied scenario-screening rules to obtain the functional test scenarios with different traffic environments and driving task complexities, which ensured the coverage of the test scenarios and reduced the number of test scenarios. The problem arose that the amount of test cases was too large after the discretized combination of test scenario parameters, so we adopted a three-way combinatorial testing strategy to greatly reduce the number of test cases. Taking the complicated lane changing scenario of the ego-vehicle as an example, the simulation method was adopted, and the critical test cases were obtained by screening through safety indicators.

There is a likelihood that the use of technology may reduce human error, making driving safer. So, the major challenge is to overcome the road safety approach. That is automated vehicles will run but main focus will be road safety. Every car participant is doing all they can to make it a reality. Audi, BMW, Ford, Google, General Motors, Tesla, Volkswagen, and Volvo are just some of the automakers working on or testing autonomous cars. Google's “Waymo” is one of the most active projects in this area. In this effort, an Arduino Uno prototype of a driverless car with rudimentary functionality was created. To acquire the route, Gmaps was used to create a map with the origin and destination supplied. The route is then downloaded in Keyhole Markup Language (KML) format, and latitude and longitude are extracted using the convertcsv.com service. The latitude and longitude were then supplied in array format in the Arduino UNO code at the proper spots. An application is developed to extract the vehicle's current movement or the real-time tracking of the vehicle movement as per the calculation of longitude and latitudes of the positional vehicle movement to the thingspeak cloud, all while displaying the coordinates on a real- time map. The mobile Assisted Global Positioning System (AGPS) sensor is built into most modern smartphones. The gmap route's latitudes and longitudes are saved in an array, and once the Arduino UNO gets the most up-to-date information from the Thingspeak cloud through the esp8266 Wi-Fi module, it begins calculating the necessary angle and distance to drive self- driving vehicle.","","979-8-3503-0336-0","10.1109/CISCT57197.2023.10351429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10351429","Navigation System;Python;Arduino UNO;Assisted Global Positioning System (AGPS);Keyhole Markup Language (KML)","Technological innovation;Navigation;Robot kinematics;Markup languages;Sociology;Road safety;Automobiles","","","","17","IEEE","21 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially inter-turn short circuit (ITSC) faults caused by electrical insulation failures in the stator windings of typically used permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) can lead to shorts to ground resulting in undesired behaviours such as oscillations in torque and localized heating. To detect and isolate ITSC faults, we propose a model-based sliding mode approach. An online parameter estimation in each stator phase of a three-phase PMSM prototype is carried out. Robustness, feasibility, and effectiveness of this scheme are elaborated by benchmarking with the state-of-the-art solution, the extended Kalman filter (EKF).

Solution separation tests are exploited to detect and exclude faults from GPS and 5G signals due to transmitter failures and local threats in urban environments (e.g., multipath). Experimental results are presented to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework under different sensor fusion scenarios. It is shown that fusing 5G signals enhances the FDE performance of the multi-sensor system in a suburban scenario: while INS/GPS fails to detect faulty GPS measurements, the INS/GPS/SOP is able to detect the fault. Moreover, over a trajectory of 1.91 km traversed in 200 s, using signals from two 5G gNBs, the INS/GPS/5G system achieved a position root-mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.81 m and maximum position error of 2.17 m.

The correlation between the vehicle sideslip error and the inertial navigation system (INS) heading error is presented first. Then, the observability for the heading error in a velocity-based Kalman filter is discussed and a novel index is defined to check the observability of the heading error. The course from a single antenna GNSS in an autonomous vehicle is augmented to estimate the heading error when the observability of the heading error is low. To reject the course measurement for scenarios that include sideslip movement, a binary hypothesis test approach is applied to indicate whether the vehicle is sidesliping. In addition, based on the OI and the sideslip indicator, a hybrid feedback strategy is designed for the heading error correction. To improve the convergence rate of the heading error in the velocity-based Kalman filter, a tuning strategy is presented. The stochastical observability of the designed Kalman observer is investigated for known and stochastic initial conditions. Finally, the proposed sideslip angle estimator is experimentally validated through a vehicle test platform in critical driving scenarios.

As a result of the high number of different technologies and connectivity features involved, testing these systems to identify security vulnerabilities is a big challenge. Security testing techniques, such as penetration testing, are often manual methods that are applied comparatively late in the vehicle development process. Thus, vulnerabilities are only detected late or after development, leading to higher costs and more patching effort. To reduce the amount of testing resources in general and enable early and automated testing, model-based testing methods have been established in several domains, such as information technology and the automotive domain. The transfer of model-based testing approaches to automotive security testing could help to detect vulnerabilities earlier than other, manual methods by automatically generating, executing, or simulating security tests. In this study, we review the literature on model-based test approaches in the automotive domain. First, we consider security-independent approaches to obtain an overview of applied models, formalisms, test selection criteria, and test generation techniques. In addition, we investigate, whether and how model-based approaches are applied for automotive security testing. Overall, we identified 63 publications related to model-based testing and 29 publications with regard to model-based security testing.

To fill this gap, we propose an intelligent testing method based on operable testing tasks. We found that the driving behavior of Surrounding Vehicles (SVs) has a critical impact on AV, which can be used to adjust the testing task difficulty to find more challenging scenarios. To model different driving behaviors, we utilize behavioral utility functions with binary driving strategies.

However, ensuring their reliability and safety is challenging due to their complex nature. Conventional test adequacy metrics, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional software testing, are often insufficient or impractical for these systems. White-box metrics, which are specifically designed for these systems, leverage neuron coverage information. These coverage metrics necessitate access to the underlying AI model and training data, which may not always be available. Furthermore, the existing adequacy metrics exhibit weak correlations with the ability to detect faults in the generated test suite, creating a gap that we aim to bridge in this study. In this paper, we introduce a set of black-box test adequacy metrics called “Test suite Instance Space Adequacy” (TISA) metrics, which can be used to gauge the effectiveness of a test suite. The TISA metrics offer a way to assess both the diversity and coverage of the test suite and the range of bugs detected during testing. Additionally, we introduce a framework that permits testers to visualise the diversity and coverage of the test suite in a two-dimensional space, facilitating the identification of areas that require improvement. We evaluate the efficacy of the TISA metrics by examining their correlation with the number of bugs detected in system-level simulation testing of AVs. A strong correlation, coupled with the short computation time, indicates their effectiveness and efficiency in estimating the adequacy of testing AVs.","1558-1225","979-8-4007-0217-4","10.1145/3597503.3623314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10548794","","Measurement;Software testing;Correlation;Computer bugs;Training data;Software reliability;Safety","","","","87","","14 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These techniques suffer from limitations such as scalability, need for significant human effort and inability to detect overlooked or unknown ONBs. To address these limitations we need a technique that analyzes requirements with respect to functional safety, but with less human effort. To achieve this, we propose our artificial intelligence-based model-driven methodology that provides a means to find ONBs during requirements engineering with minimal human effort. Our methodology utilizes existing approaches such as causal component model (CCM) and systems theoretic process analysis (STPA). We describe the details of each step of our approach and how our approach would support finding ONBs.

In order to stay safe, throughout the drive experience under four risk conditions (very high risk, high risk, low risk and no risk) that are based on automotive safety and integrity levels (ASIL D, C, B, A), participants exhibit either high or low trust by evaluating the AVs' to be highly or less trustworthy and consequently relying on the Artificial intelligence or the joystick to control the vehicle. The result of the experiment shows that there is significant increase in users' trust and user's delegation of controls to AVs' as risk decreases and vice-versa.

As AI systems penetrate the aspects of everyday life, a pressing need arises to explain their decision-making processes to build trust and familiarity among end users. In high-stakes fields such as healthcare and self-driving cars, AI systems are required to have a minimum standard for accuracy and to provide well-designed explanations for their output, especially when they impact human life. Although many techniques have been developed to make algorithms explainable in human terms, no design methodologies that will allow software teams to systematically draw out and address explainability-related issues during AI design and conception have been established. In response to this gap, we proposed the explainability in design (EID) methodological framework for addressing explainability problems in AI systems. We explored the literature on AI explainability to narrow down the field into six major explainability principles that will aid designers in brainstorming around the metrics and guide the critical thinking process. EID is a step-by-step guide to AI design that has been refined over a series of user studies and interviews with experts in AI explainability. It is devised for software design teams to uncover and resolve potential issues in their AI products and to simply refine and explore the explainability of their products and systems. The EID methodology is a novel framework that aids in the design and conception stages of the AI pipeline and can be integrated into the form of a step-by-step card game. Empirical studies involving AI system designers have shown that EID can decrease the barrier of entry and the time and experience required to effectively make well-informed decisions for integrating explainability into their AI solutions.","2398-7294","","10.26599/IJCS.2022.9100034","Nanyang Technological University; National Research Foundation, Singapore(grant numbers:AISG2-RP-2020-019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10159627","explainable artificial intelligence (AI);design method;design tool;values sensitive design;ethics;design methodology","Software design;Design methodology;Software algorithms;Pipelines;Pressing;Medical services;Software","","5","","28","","22 Jun 2023","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Some recent studies have successfully used the metamorphic testing technique to detect thousands of potential issues in some popularly used autonomous driving models. However, prior study is limited to a small set of metamorphic relations, which do not reflect rich, real-world traffic scenarios and are also not customizable. This paper presents a novel declarative rule-based metamorphic testing framework called RMT. RMT provides a rule template with natural language syntax, allowing users to flexibly specify an enriched set of testing scenarios based on real-world traffic rules and domain knowledge. RMT automatically parses human-written rules to metamorphic relations using an NLP-based rule parser referring to an ontology list and generates test cases with a variety of image transformation engines. We evaluated RMT on three autonomous driving models. With an enriched set of metamorphic relations, RMT detected a significant number of abnormal model predictions that were not detected by prior work. Through a large-scale human study on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we further confirmed the authenticity of test cases generated by RMT and the validity of detected abnormal model predictions.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3206427","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP210102447); ARC Linkage(grant numbers:LP190100676); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906558","Metamorphic testing;Autonomous driving;testing","Testing;Autonomous vehicles;Predictive models;Roads;Ontologies;Vehicles;Natural languages","","10","","91","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of its stages is the design of a data transmission subsystem between the vehicle's hardware units. Requirements are growing not only for throughput, but also for the ease of use of the interface when developing, testing and upgrading HAVs. A promising approach is the use of computer-aided design (CAD) tools to automate the process of generating data exchange code for embedded software of electronic control units. This allows to minimize cost, reduce the likelihood of design errors, and increase overall architectural flexibility. This article describes an approach to speed up the design of a data exchange subsystem for HAVs by developing CAD elements for code fragments generation of data transfer software between electronic control units.

However, it is still impossible to achieve the autonomous driving in all conditions in the short term, which may give rise to safety problems because of transitions between human and machine in the autonomous driving. This paper studied the definition and categorization of human-machine transitions, and proposed key issues concerning environment perception, personnel training and the transition mechanism by looking at the development of human-machine transitions in other industries. Also, this paper made a review of domestic and foreign literatures on these issues. The environment perception was found to be a key factor affecting human-machine transitions. There have been studies on factors that could influence the perception of drivers. However, the influencing mechanism remains unclear, preventing it from being applied in the design of human-machine transitions. Researchers have reached consensus on the significance of pre-use training on autonomous driving and compared the effects of various training programs. However, a comprehensive training system is not available yet, and there are no studies on the training criteria, preventing the accessibility of regulatory training in the short term. The design of human-machine transitions is still in the initial stage, consisting of a one-time reminder to the driver and waiting for taken over. Some researchers are working on the multi-step transition design and attempting to apply it in the real scenario, however its effects still need to be validated. Finally, the paper proposed suggestions on studies of human-machine transition based on domestic and foreign research.","","978-1-6654-0413-6","10.1109/ICSP51882.2021.9408640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9408640","component;autonomous driving;human-machine transition;safety;environment perception of the driver;training of autonomous driving;design of transition steps","Training;Industries;Systematics;Switches;Signal processing;Safety;Task analysis","","","","76","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The overactuated vehicle is an omnidirectional mobile platform with redundant actuators such as four independent driven wheels, four independent braking wheels, and four-wheel steering systems. The supervision system is able to monitor the health condition of the vehicle and to study the fault recoverability possibilities to reconfigure the control input when a fault occurs. For FD, analytical redundancy relations (ARRs) are derived from the bond graph model. The latter is constraint relations describing the nominal system behavior and is written in terms of the measured system variables. To perform robust FD, adaptive thresholds are generated. They consider modeling and measurement uncertainties. Once a fault is detected, the structural recoverability algorithm analyzes the redundancy presented on the system, and an appropriate control strategy is applied. The designed procedure of FD and FTC is validated by considering a multiple-fault scenario on the vehicle and comparing its results with the nominal case.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2013.2274289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6710264","Fault diagnosis (FD);fault-tolerant control (FTC);intelligent autonomous vehicle (IAV);modeling;overactuated electric-vehicle path tracking","Vehicles;Wheels;Mathematical model;Measurement uncertainty;Sensors;Robustness;Trajectory","","52","","22","IEEE","14 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such systems grow ubiquitous, there is a commensurate need to protect against potentially catastrophic harm. System-level testing in simulation is a particularly promising approach for assuring robotics systems, allowing for more extensive testing in realistic scenarios and seeking bugs that may not manifest at the unit-level. Ideally, such testing could find critical bugs well before expensive field-testing is required. However, simulations can only model coarse environmental abstractions, contributing to a common perception that robotics bugs can only be found in live deployment. To address this gap, we conduct an empirical study on bugs that have been fixed in the widely used, open-source ArduPilot system. We identify bug-fixing commits by exploiting commenting conventions in the version-control history. We provide a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the bugs, focusing on characterising how the bugs are triggered and how they can be detected, with a goal of identifying how they can be best identified in simulation, well before field testing. To our surprise, we find that the majority of bugs manifest under simple conditions that can be easily reproduced in software-based simulation. Conversely, we find that system configurations and forms of input play an important role in triggering bugs. We use these results to inform a novel framework for testing for these and other bugs in simulation, consistently and reproducibly. These contributions can inform the construction of techniques for automated testing of robotics systems, with the goal of finding bugs early and cheaply, without incurring the costs of physically testing for bugs in live systems.","","978-1-5386-5012-7","10.1109/ICST.2018.00040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8367060","automated testing;empirical study;robotics;autonomous vehicles;dataset;repository mining;ardupilot;testing;simulation","Computer bugs;Testing;Autonomous systems;Robot kinematics;History;Software","","42","","43","IEEE","28 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a novel validation method named Virtual Assessment of Automation in Field Operation (VAAFO) is introduced in detail. In VAAFO, HAD system has no access to actuators but runs in parallel while human driver drives the vehicle. Behavior comparison between human-driven vehicle and HAD in same scenario is a main new feature in VAAFO to validate automated driving and find out potential critical scenarios. Combined with correction of world model and criticality metrics, potential critical scenarios are filtered further to identify real critical scenarios. Different modules of VAAFO are explained elaborately based on these working principles. In principle, the proposed method could accelerate testing and validation of HAD a lot without bringing additional risks. Moreover, critical scenarios will be identified as well.","","978-1-5386-7024-8","10.1109/ITSC.2019.8917045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8917045","","Trajectory;Testing;Roads;Safety;Automobiles;Measurement","","15","","27","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Leveraging typical use cases extracted from naturalistic driving events, we establish a strong link between proving ground testing results of CAVs and their anticipated public street performance. We present benchmark results of our approach on three world-class CAV testing facilities: Mcity, Almono (Uber ATG), and Kcity.

The intention of a pedestrian to cross the street can be influenced by social interactions with another one across the street, which may be manifested through various types of social signals such as hand waving. Current socially-aware multi-pedestrian path predictors mainly rely on geometric heuristics such as the distance between pedestrians in the field of view of the car, but do not consider their social interaction across the street. This paper presents a novel social interaction-based multi-pedestrian path predictor (SIMP3) which leverages a combination of dynamic Bayesian networks for intention detection and recurrent network for prediction of future pedestrian locations. The system has been evaluated on the benchmark OpenDS-CTS2 of critical traffic scenarios with socially interacting pedestrians across the street simulated in OpenDS.

One of the subjects that are known as Pedestrian Detection (PD), is criticized with a lot of problems that are needed to be solved for autonomous cars. Although a significant amount of work has been done for solving these problems, the outcomes have not satisfied the needs of PD. The shortcomings are mainly attributed to datasets, which are believed to be extended significantly to cover real-life scenarios, and utilizing systems, which seem to fail to cover challenging cases due to high dependence on parameters and low generalization capacity. For solving these problems, extensive datasets are collected and existing annotations are updated. More complex and advanced detection/classification systems are developed. Although higher accuracies can be achieved, such datasets and models cause further problems in real-time operation. Accordingly, this study focuses on PD and provides insights from multiple challenging perspectives. First, the main goal is building models for Alpha Development Board, which is constructed for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. Since the use of deep models is still not easy to be executed on dedicated hardware, as a second step, one of the most used approaches to boost PD performance, well-established hand-crafted feature-classifier combinations, are implemented. Third, the implemented methods are applied to recent datasets to observe the performance as well as inter-dataset dependency.

The shift from testing conventional vehicles to autonomous ones marks a fundamental change in testing approaches. Safeguarding autonomous driving system (ADS) safety is a complex challenge, demanding a meticulous examination of concepts and testing procedures. Despite the recent proliferation of various ADS testing methods, there’s a lack of clarity regarding a comprehensive list of these methods and the metrics used for performance assessment. To address this gap, a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art ADS testing methodologies and the crucial metrics employed within each is presented. It recommends five testing methods and introduces five types of metrics to expedite the development of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, it unravels the complexities of testing autonomous vehicles, pinpointing both scenario creation hurdles and technical limitations, before charting a course towards reliable deployment through targeted solutions like AI-powered tooling and data labeling automation.

Industry 5.0 would present massive customization via transformative technologies, such as cyber-physical systems (CPSs), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics. In Industry 5.0, the AI models must be transparent, valid, and interpretable. AI models employ machine learning and deep learning mechanisms to make the industrial process autonomous, reduce downtime, and improve operational and maintenance costs. However, the models require explainability in the learning process. Thus, explainable AI (EXAI) adds interpretability and improves the diagnosis of critical industrial processes, which augments the machine-to-human explanations and vice versa. Recent surveys of EXAI in industrial applications are mostly oriented toward EXAI models, the underlying assumptions. Still, fewer studies are conducted toward a holistic integration of EXAI with human-centric processes that drives the Industry 5.0 applicative verticals. Thus, to address the gap, we propose a first-of-its-kind survey that systematically untangles EXAI integration and its potential in Industry 5.0 applications. First, we present the background of EXAI in Industry 5.0 and CPSs and a reference EXAI-based Industry 5.0 architecture with insights into large language models.

An example of an MR is the expectation that the sum of an arbitrary list of integers remain unchanged regardless of it being sorted or reversed. Thus, a key requirement for applying MT effectively is availability of MRs specific to the domain at hand. In this paper, we propose MT to the domain of processor verification. As a case study, we consider the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and provide MRs tailored for RISC-V For evaluation purposes, we propose an efficient on-the-fly MT framework that integrates the MRs with an Instruction Set Simulator (ISS). We measure the quality of those MRs by the number of mutations they kill, also referred to as mutation analysis. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MRs to kill all mutations, which confirms our research question that MT is also a suitable technique for the domain of processor verification.","2324-8440","978-1-6654-2614-5","10.1109/VLSI-SoC53125.2021.9606997","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606997","","Instruction sets;Computer architecture;Very large scale integration;Software;Testing","","3","","18","IEEE","17 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ExVivoMicroTest exploits cloud technologies, containers in particular, to generate a mocked environment that fully isolates the service under test from the rest of the system.

To demonstrate its applicability, we apply StellaUAV to generate test cases for various situations and discover several safety distance violations of the tested exemplary UAV in the presence of dynamic obstacles. These experimental results indicate that the given system under test can handle situations with only static obstacles rather well, while it encounters problems when facing dynamic ones. Further, we detect that a combination of optimization algorithms can find safety distance violations for a logical scenario that the widely used algorithm NSGAII deemed safe for the tested system.

The arduous task has two components: (i) improving the existing traffic policies based on a good understanding of risk factors related to trends in traffic accidents, and (ii) underpinning the emerging technologies that will advance the safety of vehicles. For the latter route, the introduction of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is a promising option as CAVs can potentially reduce the number of accidents. However, to reap their benefits, they need to be introduced in a safe manner and tested for their ability to safely deal with risky scenarios. Unfortunately, the identification of such test scenarios remains a key challenge for the industry. This study contributes to increased safety by (i) analyzing UK’s STATS19 accident data to identify patterns in past traffic accidents, and (ii) utilizing this information to systematically generate scenarios for CAV testing. For task (i), the patterns in the accidents were identified in terms of static and time-dependent internal and external factors. For this purpose, the study employed a clustering algorithm, COOLCAT, which is particularly suitable for dealing with high-dimensional categorical data. Six different clusters emerged naturally as a result of the algorithm. To interpret the clusters, we applied a frequency analysis to each cluster. The frequency tests showed that in each cluster, certain distinct real-world situations were represented more significantly compared to the non-clustered reference case, which are the markers of each cluster. The second task (ii) complemented the first task by synthesizing the relationships between attributes. This was done by association rule mining using the market basket analysis approach. The method enabled us to develop, drawing from the characteristics of the clusters, non-trivial test scenarios that can be used in the testing of CAVs, especially in virtual testing.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3140052","Innovate U.K. and Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV) through the OmniCAV Project(grant numbers:104529); UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Future Leaders Fellowship(grant numbers:MR/S035176/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9675287","Accident analysis;scenario development;cluster analysis;market basket analysis","Accidents;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Testing;Clustering methods;Task analysis;Junctions","","16","","63","CCBY","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The absence of a reliable functional testing approach is one of the main issues with current technology. Currently, testing scenario libraries are created manually by testers, which has the drawback of being scarce and ineffective. Traditional automated generating algorithms provide limited-coverage scenarios that do not account for the influence of sensors. Our contributions to solving these issues are as follows. First, we extract the roads in the research region from OpenStreetMap (OSM), filter them, and annotate them using hierarchical clustering of feature values, which creates a static road library. Second, reinforcement learning is used to model dynamic situations using a partly observable Markov decision process (POMDP) in conjunction with sensor inputs. The creation process can be run concurrently with functional tests. Third, the efficiency of simulation testing is increased by integrating the static road library and the dynamic scenario section to produce a sizable library of test scenarios. This increases the realism and coverage of the library. The experimental results show that the proposed scene construction method is well suited for use in SUMO, VTD and other simulators, and has a 388% improvement in scenario coverage compared to the traditional method.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3266639","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10103222","Connected and automated vehicle;testing scenario library;partially observable Markov decision process","Testing;Roads;Libraries;Sensors;Vehicle dynamics;Analytical models;Automobiles","","4","","38","IEEE","17 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the applications that perceive one video with multiple image frames, such as autonomous driving, usually further require the trajectories of objects. This is mainly realized by combining detecting objects and associating detected objects in frames using multiple object tracking (MOT) systems. Thus, it is also essential to test the robustness of MOT systems, particularly in their exclusive scenarios that involve variety beyond the static image content. In this paper, we propose a novel testing method with five new Metamorphic Relations to realize the robustness test for MOT systems in two typical categories of scenarios, i.e., the speed variety of tracked objects and temporary camera failures.

Mutation-based testing is a very successful technique for testing DNNs by mutating their complex structures. Deep Mutation Module was developed to address mutation-based testing and the robustness challenges of DNNs. It analyses the structures of DNNs in detail. It tests models by applying mutation to parameters and structures using its fault library. Testing DNN structures and detecting faults is a highly complex and open-ended challenge. The method proposed in this study applies mutations to DNN parameters to expose faults and weaknesses in the models, thereby testing their robustness. The paper focuses on mutation-based tests of an Reinforce Learning (RL) model developed for electric vehicle routing, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model developed for prognostic predictions, and a Transformer-based neural network model for electric vehicle routing tasks. The best mutation scores for the LSTM model were measured as 96%, 91.02%, 71.19%, and 68.77%. The test results for the RL model resulted in mutation scores of 93.20%, 72.13%, 77.47%, 79.28%, and 55.74%. The mutation scores of the Transformer model were 75.87%, 76.36%, and 74.93%. These results show that the module can successfully test the targeted models and generate mutants classified as “survived mutants” that outperform the original models. In this way, it provides critical information to researchers to improve the overall performance of the models. Conducting these tests before using them in real-world applications minimizes faults and maximizes model success.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3482114","Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye(grant numbers:22AG040); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10720015","Convolutional neural network;deep neural networks;long short-term memory;machine learning;mutation-based testing;reinforcement learning;transformers","Testing;Artificial neural networks;Robustness;Software testing;Long short term memory;Accuracy;Transformers;Predictive models;Libraries;Convolutional neural networks;Artificial neural networks;Reinforcement learning","","","","32","CCBYNCND","16 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there is nearly no enough diagnostic experience accumulated in these new devices, and thus, it is hardly suitable to only apply the traditional expert/experience-based fault diagnosis approach. Thus, model-based diagnosis was proposed for efficient detection of faulty components; this approach explores the behavioral and structural information of the device to be diagnosed, and no experience is required. In model-based diagnosis, for a device to be diagnosed, minimal conflict sets of components are first generated, and all minimal hitting-sets for them will be derived as candidate diagnoses. Therefore, it is vital to efficiently generate all minimal hitting-sets to find the final diagnosis. Unfortunately, it is proven to be NP-hard when deriving all minimal hitting-sets for given minimal conflict sets. To improve the computing efficiency, in this article, we propose a novel approach called TreeMerge, which considers a special type of tree structure of minimal conflict sets of large sizes since structural information usually plays an important role in solving complex problems. Theoretically, compared with other algorithms, the time complexity of the new algorithm is greatly reduced, as the time complexity of the new algorithm becomes linear rather than quadratic. Furthermore, experimental results on multiple synthetic and benchmark examples show that the proposed TreeMerge algorithm is more efficient than many other state-of-the-art methods, with a reduction of several orders of magnitude runtime (seconds).","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2021.3115130","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972360,62072392,62076108); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9577218","Conflict set;divide and conquer;hitting-set;model-based diagnosis;tree","Time complexity;Minimization;Fault diagnosis;Context modeling;Computational modeling;Benchmark testing;Space exploration","","1","","51","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because of noise interference, the extraction of useful fault features for an accurate fault diagnosis of steering actuator becomes an arduous task. This article proposes an adaptive denoising residual network (AD-ResNet) for fault diagnosis of steering actuator with reduced noise interference and improved accuracy. First, a high-complexity model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) is built to estimate redundant signals, and then, fault features are generated by comparing redundant signals with the measured sensor signals. Second, an attention unit is designed to determine the unique set of thresholds for each fault feature. Finally, hard thresholding is embedded in a deep network as a nonlinear transform layer to reduce noise. Simulation experiments were performed at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and the results confirmed that the proposed method could adaptively denoise the high-noise signals. The proposed method was then validated against a fault dataset that was built using road experiments with an autonomous vehicle, and it achieved an accuracy, a sensitivity, a specificity, and an F1-score of 91.66%, 91.66%, 97.22%, and 0.9159, respectively, averaged over all fault states.

Given an ODD, the testing scenario library is defined as a critical set of scenarios that can be used for CAV test. Each testing scenario is evaluated by a newly proposed measure, scenario criticality, which can be computed as a combination of maneuver challenge and exposure frequency. To search for critical scenarios, an auxiliary objective function is designed, and a multi-start optimization method along with seed-filling is applied. Theoretical analysis suggests that the proposed framework can obtain accurate evaluation results with much fewer number of tests, if compared with the on-road test method.

However, for AVs to operate at their optimum capabilities, they need to go through a comprehensive testing and verification process. While a large amount of research and funding has been provided for solving this problem, there is still a lack of a systematic method to develop standardized tests that can be used to judge if the decision-making capability functions are within acceptable parameters. To that end, the tests need to cover all possible situations that an AV may run into. This paper focuses on defining the notion of coverage mathematically when using pseudo-randomly generated simulations for testing. The approach defines new equivalence relations between scenes, which are the systems’ various states, to achieve this goal. Considering the substantial need for computation, even with the obtained coverage, we also introduce the mathematical definition of a sub-scene and additional strategies, such as expanding the equivalence classes of scenes and combining actors in scenes, to reduce the amount of testing required to certify AVs.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3074062","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1919855); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9406805","Autonomous vehicles;coverage;model of computation;safety;testing and verification framework","Testing;Mathematical model;Roads;Autonomous vehicles;Vehicle dynamics;Systematics;Decision making","","10","","25","CCBY","19 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Pure driving over many kilometers to gather enough evidence for a safety argument is not feasible. Scenario-based testing is an approach to overcome this, but challenges like parameter discretization still prevail, hindering safety assurance. This work proposes contributions towards a traceable and efficient safety argumentation for ADS built upon ODD coverage. First, ODD coverage is thoroughly quantified across all scenario levels, assuming distribution functions’ availability for the scenario parameters. Secondly, a sampling method for n-dimensional scenario parameter distributions is proposed. The provided algorithms adapt an initial k-means clustering using pre-defined boundary conditions requiring significantly fewer scenarios. Furthermore, a risk metric for urban intersections is presented for scenario evaluation. The risk metric consists of two parts, scene prediction of traffic participants (TPs) and risk assessment. The scene prediction uses a manoeuvre-based motion model with a data-driven approach towards trajectory prediction, increasing the validity. For the risk assessment, a probabilistic risk prediction for the TPs is performed for each scenario scene. The risk metric shows a reasonable tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity, outperforming time-to-collision. These contributions are exemplarily applied at an intersection using a simplified setup for generating TPs and ego vehicle trajectories. The results indicate that an increased safety argumentation is enabled using the proposed methods alongside a coverage process, facilitating further research.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3242127","Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies (COMET) K2 Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies from the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action (BMK); Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs (BMDW); Province of Styria (Dept. 12); Styrian Business Promotion Agency (SFG); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10036064","Automated vehicles;autonomous vehicles;automated driving;validation;coverage;operational design domain;automotive safety;vehicle safety;safety argumentation","Safety;Autonomous vehicles;Testing;Probability density function;Vehicle safety;Trajectory;Remotely guided vehicles","","15","","78","CCBY","3 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To ensure vehicle safety, unmanned driving systems should be rigorously tested before deployment. With the rapid development of digital twin technology, offline testing in cyberspace has gained increasing significance. While numerous driving simulators have been recently released, none of them can support simulation tests in mines.

We also design multiple novel strategies for neuron selection to improve the neuron coverage.

We present empirical evaluations on two well-known data-sets to demonstrate its effectiveness.

But DLFuzz could generate $338.59\%$ more adversarial inputs with $89.82\%$ smaller perturbations, while maintaining the identities of the original inputs. DLFuzz also managed to averagely obtain $2.86\%$ higher neuron coverage, and save $20.11\%$ time consumption with respect to DeepXplore.

Thus, in a deterministic simulation environment, tests are rendered repeatable and yield simulation results that are trustworthy and straightforward to debug. However, game engines are seldom deterministic. This paper reviews and identifies the potential causes and effects of non-deterministic behaviours in game engines. A case study using CARLA, an open-source autonomous driving simulation environment powered by Unreal Engine, is presented to highlight its inherent shortcomings in providing sufficient precision in experimental results. Different configurations and utilisations of the software and hardware are explored to determine an operational domain where the simulation precision is sufficiently high i.e. variance between repeated executions becomes negligible for development and testing work. Finally, a method of a general nature is proposed, that can be used to find the domains of permissible variance in game engine simulations for any given system configuration.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3177887","ROBOPILOT and CAPRI projects through the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV), delivered in partnership with Innovate U.K(grant numbers:103703,103288); “UKRI Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Node in Functionality”(grant numbers:EP/V026518/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793395","Autonomous driving;autonomous vehicles;determinism;game engines;physics engines;verification and validation (V&V);simulation;testing","Engines;Games;Testing;Autonomous vehicles;Data models;Simulation;Computational modeling","","11","","58","CCBY","10 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The CBF supervises a nominal unsafe PID controller on the AV’s velocity. The experimental testing spans two months of driving, of which 1.9 hours of data is collected in which the CBF and nominal controller are active. We find that violations of the guaranteed minimum time-gap are observed, as measured by the vehicle’s on-board radar unit. There are two distinct causes of the violations. First, in multi-lane traffic, Cut-ins from other vehicles represent external disturbances that can immediately violate the minimum guaranteed time gap provided by the CBF. When cut-ins occur, the CBF does eventually return the vehicle to a safe time gap. Second, even when cut-ins do not occur, system model inaccuracies (e.g., sensor error and delay, actuator error and delay) can lead to violations of the minimum time-gap. These violations are small relative to the violations that would have occurred using only the unsafe nominal control law.","","978-1-6654-7042-1","10.1109/DI-CPS56137.2022.00011","Office of Energy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9805362","Autonomous-Vehicles;Transportation;Safe-Control","Actuators;Smart cities;Radar measurements;Conferences;Radar;Traffic control;Cyber-physical systems","","2","","16","IEEE","27 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The literature also advocates the notion of requirements-based testing (RBT) focusing on checking both the quality attributes and implementation of requirements. As requirements reside in the environment comprised of certain problem domain phenomena, the environment assertions connecting some of these phenomena in the indicative mood play a critical part in determining the correctness of a software solution. For formulating environment assertions, current literature provides manual techniques that are extremely time consuming and highly dependent on an individual's domain knowledge. In addition, developers often struggle to formulate good assertions from scratch. To address this issue, our work develops a boilerplate with certain placeholders that can be replaced with relevant attributes to formulate individual environment assertions. Leveraging this boilerplate, we further present a framework to capture environment assertions in an automated manner. An empirical study, involving 45 developers and 56 different software systems from 13 application domains, suggests that our framework captures useful environment assertions that are also relevant to software providing similar features in other application domains. Our work, to that end, opens new avenues for further coordination between RE and testing.","","978-1-6654-3875-9","10.1109/IRI51335.2021.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9599110","environment assertions;requirements-based testing;requirements engineering and testing","Mood;Focusing;Manuals;Software systems;Market research;Rough surfaces;Risk analysis","","2","","35","IEEE","17 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As high-tech safety systems are being built into automobiles these days, the future of the cockpit is changing. Users will expect connected, secure, and improved mobility interfaces from the digital cockpit of the future. Without sacrificing security or performance, a digital cockpit controller system allows for the simultaneous operation of Infotainment, Instrument Cluster, and ADAS functions in real time from a single SoC. It is capable of powering several HuD and other high-resolution monitors. New connected features, intuitive HMI, on-the-go entertainment, and safety features are drawing in customers, making it crucial for OEMs to set themselves apart in the realm of Cockpit electronics. The modern digital cockpit is defined by features such as internet-connected infotainment systems with a virtual assistant and streaming media, larger and higher resolution 3D displays, all-digital instrument clusters, Augmented reality-based head-up displays, and other advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) like surround-view, eMirror, etc. Expansion opportunities exist for suppliers of linked digital cockpits thanks to the development of a cockpit domain controller architecture that consolidates these disparate functions onto a single multi-core SoC and ECUs.

Given the infinite possible environmental scenarios, it is essential to find critical scenarios efficiently. To this end, we propose a novel testing method, named EpiTESTER, by taking inspiration from epigenetics, which enables species to adapt to sudden environmental changes. In particular, EpiTESTER adopts gene silencing as its epigenetic mechanism, which regulates gene expression to prevent the expression of a certain gene, and the probability of gene expression is dynamically computed as the environment changes. Given different data modalities (e.g., images, lidar point clouds) in the context of AV, EpiTESTER benefits from a multi-model fusion transformer to extract high-level feature representations from environmental factors. Next, it calculates probabilities based on these features with the attention mechanism. To assess the cost-effectiveness of EpiTESTER, we compare it with a probabilistic search algorithm (Simulated Annealing, SA), a classical genetic algorithm (GA) (i.e., without any epigenetic mechanism implemented), and EpiTESTER with equal probability for each gene. We evaluate EpiTESTER with six initial environments from CARLA, an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research, and two end-to-end AV controllers, Interfuser and TCP. Our results show that EpiTESTER achieved a promising performance in identifying critical scenarios compared to the baselines, showing that applying epigenetic mechanisms is a good option for solving practical problems.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2024.3449429","Research Council of Norway(grant numbers:#286898/F20,270053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10645815","Autonomous vehicle testing;epigenetic algorithm;attention mechanism","Epigenetics;Testing;Genetic algorithms;Attention mechanisms;Transformers;Feature extraction;Pedestrians","","","","73","IEEE","23 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Systematically testing these performance concerns is however extremely difficult, in particular because there exists no theory underpinning the evaluation of a performance test suite, i.e., to tell the software developer whether such a test suite is ”good enough” or even whether a test suite is better than another one. This paper proposes to apply Multimorphic testing and empirically assess the effectiveness of performance test suites of software systems coming from various domains. By analogy with mutation testing, our core idea is to leverage the typical configurability of these systems, and to check whether it makes any difference in the outcome of the tests: i.e., are some tests able to “kill” underperforming system configurations? More precisely, we propose a framework for defining and evaluating the coverage of a test suite with respect to a quantitative property of interest. Such properties can be the execution time, the memory usage or the success rate in tasks performed by a software system. This framework can be used to assess whether a new test case is worth adding to a test suite or to select an optimal test suite with respect to a property of interest. We evaluate several aspects of our proposal through 3 empirical studies carried out in different fields: object tracking in videos, object recognition in images, and code generators.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2019.2926971","ANR-17-CE25-0010-01 VaryVary; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8755468","Software product lines;software testing;performance testing;test evaluation","Testing;Software measurement;Software systems;Videos;Task analysis;Generators","","4","","63","IEEE","4 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The time-to-collision (TTC), the longitudinal distance between two vehicles, and the steering wheel angle at the begin time of the overtaking behavior are taken as the analysis indicators to characterize the behavior characteristics of the driver. The result shows that the different speeds of the vehicle have no statistically significant effects on the behavior characteristics of the driver (TTC, $\mathbf{P}{=0.187 > 0.05;}$ Longitudinal distance, $\mathbf{P}{=0.682 > 0.05;}$ Steering Angle, $\mathbf{P}{=0.052 > 0.05).}$ The speed difference will significantly affect the values of the above three indicators.

Deep learning-based object detector approaches have enabled great advances in using camera imagery to detect and classify objects. But for a safety critical application, such as autonomous driving, the error rates of the current state of the art are still too high to enable safe operation. Moreover, the characterization of object detector performance is primarily limited to testing on prerecorded datasets. Errors that occur on novel data go undetected without additional human labels. In this letter, we propose an automated method to identify mistakes made by object detectors without ground truth labels. We show that inconsistencies in the object detector output between a pair of similar images can be used as hypotheses for false negatives (e.g., missed detections) and using a novel set of features for each hypothesis, an off-the-shelf binary classifier can be used to find valid errors. In particular, we study two distinct cues–temporal and stereo  inconsistencies—using data that are readily available on most autonomous vehicles. Our method can be used with any camera-based object detector and we illustrate the technique on several sets of real world data. We show that a state-of-the-art detector, tracker, and our classifier trained only on synthetic data can identify valid errors on KITTI tracking dataset with an average precision of 0.94.

One contributing method is scenario-based assessment in which test cases are derived from real-world road traffic scenarios obtained from driving data. Given the complexity of the reality that is being modeled in these scenarios, it is a challenge to define a structure for capturing these scenarios. An intensional definition that provides a set of characteristics that are deemed to be both necessary and sufficient to qualify as a scenario assures that the scenarios constructed are both complete and intercomparable. In this article, we develop a comprehensive and operable definition of the notion of scenario while considering existing definitions in the literature. This is achieved by proposing an object-oriented framework in which scenarios and their building blocks are defined as classes of objects having attributes, methods, and relationships with other objects. The object-oriented approach promotes clarity, modularity, reusability, and encapsulation of the objects. We provide definitions and justifications of each of the terms. Furthermore, the framework is used to translate the terms in a coding language that is publicly available.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2022.3144803","Centre of Excellence for Testing and Research of Autonomous Vehicles at NTU; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9693162","Automatic testing;autonomous vehicles;intelligent vehicles;object-oriented modeling;performance evaluation;system testing;vehicle safety","Object oriented modeling;Vehicle dynamics;Encoding;Ontologies;Mathematical models;Safety;Intelligent vehicles","","35","","81","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To test the proposed approach, a setup that involves Texas Instruments (TI) AWR1642 77 GHz radar kit and DCA1000 FPGA board was used. In addition, a recently developed Python based testbed, developed by the authors, was used for control, data acquisition, and real-time processing of radar data (25 radar images per second without any dropped frames). Results show that the proposed approach can distinguish between moving pedestrians and vehicles with accuracy comparable to results obtained from cameras and lidars.

Software testing has been proven to be a cost-effective quality assurance method for traditional software systems but requires adaptations to address the peculiarities of AI applications. For instance, thoroughly testing the software controlling autonomous vehicles requires the definition of relevant driving scenarios and their implementation in physically accurate driving simulators, which remains an open challenge. Recent work showed that simulations of critical driving scenarios such as car crashes are fundamental to generating effective test cases. However, generating such complex simulations is challenging, and state-of-the-art approaches based on natural language descriptions struggle to complete the task. Therefore, we propose CRISCE, the first approach to create accurate car crash simulations from accident sketches.

It is difficult to employ white-box testing on DNNs since the output of a single neuron is inexplicable to developers. In this paper, we propose a black-box testing method based on metamorphic testing to test object detection systems. This method can reveal errors in object detection and generate high-quality test input data, i.e., a large amount of mutated images. To this end, we set up a metamorphic relation for evaluation on the testing results of prediction and design a novel strategy via object removal to generate mutated images. Instead of existing methods of adding noises to images, our method constructs mutated images by removing an object from the image background.

Interestingly, deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven effective for object detection in these settings. The safety of object detection in ADSs depends on the position of the detected objects and the specifications that guide the system’s response to them. Consequently, testing the object-detection process in ADSs must be grounded in these specifications. However, current specifications are informal regarding object locations and inadequate for object-detection testing. To address this issue, this article first introduces the bounding box specification language (BBSL), a framework capable of mathematically articulating the specifications for object and event detection and responses. Subsequently, we propose a specification-based testing approach for the object-detection process in ADS using BBSL. Remarkably, BBSL can formally delineate the positions of objects within the driving environment. Furthermore, our proposed approach can identify safety-critical defects that conventional tests, which focus solely on performance evaluation, might overlook. Furthermore, we propose two sets of test criteria. The first set reflects the diversity of object positions and sizes within an image, while the second set includes coverage metrics that determine whether the test cases cover all conditions outlined by the BBSL specifications. Overall, our contributions facilitate the implementation of specification-based testing for object-detection systems using DNNs, a challenge previously considered formidable.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3516082","Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST (Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology)(grant numbers:JPMJCR23M1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10795175","Automated driving;coverage;formal specification;object detection;testing","Testing;Safety;Neurons;Measurement;Image recognition;Object detection;Proposals;Codes;Standards;Source coding","","","","46","CCBY","12 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Companies are considering the inclusion of DL components in production systems, but one of their main concerns is how to assess the quality of such systems. Mutation testing is a technique to inject artificial faults into a system, under the assumption that the capability to expose (kilt) such artificial faults translates into the capability to expose also real faults. Researchers have proposed approaches and tools (e.g., Deep-Mutation and MuNN) that make mutation testing applicable to deep learning systems. However, existing definitions of mutation killing, based on accuracy drop, do not take into account the stochastic nature of the training process (accuracy may drop even when re-training the un-mutated system). Moreover, the same mutation operator might be effective or might be trivial/impossible to kill, depending on its hyper-parameter configuration. We conducted an empirical evaluation of existing operators, showing that mutation killing requires a stochastic definition and identifying the subset of effective mutation operators together with the associated most effective configurations.","2159-4848","978-1-7281-5778-8","10.1109/ICST46399.2020.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9159089","testing;mutation;deep learning","Neurons;Training data;Training;Data models;Measurement;Testing;Machine learning","","38","","27","IEEE","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The effectiveness of each model for trajectory planning is evaluated by testing the trajectories on an automated vehicle across friction conditions ranging from ice to dry asphalt. Comparisons between the outright performance of the car and the car's ability to track the optimal trajectory are made across the various models.

This paper presents a novel approach to generating synthetic collision-prone trajectories using the Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN). By leveraging CTGAN’s ability to handle imbalanced and mixed data types, we create a rich synthetic dataset that enhances the validation and testing processes for CAVs. Our methodology includes the preparation of real-world trajectory data, the configuration and training of the CTGAN model, and the generation of a diverse set of collision-prone scenarios. We test our approach using two large-scale real-world trajectory datasets and comparative analyses with other trajectory generation methods, including TimeGAN and SocialGAN, to underscore the superiority of our approach in generating realistic and varied scenarios. This research contributes to the field of autonomous vehicle testing by offering a robust and scalable solution for scenario generation. The synthetic dataset not only improves safety and reliability metrics but also provides a valuable resource for future research and development.

However, it is unclear how to define such a scenario space and the coverage criterion. This work presents a novel approach to the definition of the scenario space. Spatiotemporal filtering on naturalistic highway driving data provides a large amount of driving scenarios as a foundation.

We use a Luenberger structure for the fault detection filters and tune the observer gains based on an H/sub /spl infin//-based cost. Such a choice of cost was motivated by the need to explicitly incorporate frequency-domain-based performance objectives. The linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based formulation of an H/sub /spl infin// optimization problem of Luenberger state observers does not allow for the augmentation with dynamic performance weightings in the optimization objective, since it makes the problem a nonconvex optimization problem.

The protocol is not encrypted leading to the need of validation. A validation algorithm is proposed that makes use of Time Difference of Arrival localization to validate the position and velocity of ADS-B transmitting targets. Nowadays, Air navigation service providers (ANSP) commonly have at least one TDOA localization system in operation, allowing for cost effective implementation. Validation is achieved by using a Particle Filter and hypothesis tests. A novel method is used where the initial density is generated effectively based on the first set of TDOA measurements. Validation is possible when two or more ground stations receive the same ADS-B transmission, therefore the Particle Filter is designed to process such measurements. The algorithm is tested on data provided by Air Traffic Control The Netherlands’ North sea surveillance system. Results show that the validation works and that the algorithm is able to detect spoofing. Based on spoofed ADS-B messages and true TDOA measurements, the real and fake target can be detected when the distance is roughly 750 to 1000 meters (depending on the situation and the various tuning parameters). In addition, validation based on two or more ground stations per measurements has the effect that the validation area is increased, when compared to traditional filters that require 4 ground stations for tracking.","","978-1-7377497-6-9","10.23919/FUSION59988.2024.10706300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10706300","ADS-B;Validation;TDOA;Particle Filter;Hypothesis Testing;State Estimation;Spoofing Detection","Location awareness;Target tracking;Protocols;Costs;Atmospheric measurements;Sea measurements;Traffic control;Particle measurements;Particle filters;Tuning","","","","15","","11 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, we propose an Adaptive Design of Experiments (ADOE) method to evaluate the safety of AVs. Using this method, a Surrogate Model (SM) is established and updated iteratively. SM in ADOE is used to approximate the results of AV testing and help to select the next concrete scenario to be tested in each iteration. Two different ADOE approaches are proposed in this study for different testing purposes. Since the choice of the surrogate model has a profound impact on the performance of the ADOE method, 6 surrogate models were compared with two logical scenarios at different scales – a car following logical scenario and a cut-in logical scenario. Results show that Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) is suitable for both ADOE approaches. And both proposed ADOE approaches achieved desired performance. Scenario-oriented ADOE made full use of each concrete scenario, capturing one collision case for every 1.12 test runs in the car following logical scenario, while SM-oriented ADOE successfully depicted the boundary between safety and danger. Using 0.46% test resources compared to enumeration, the SM-oriented ADOE found 93.9% dangerous scenarios with 90.9% precision.

To this end, the nonlinear vehicle system is reformulated in a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model with both measured and unmeasured nonlinear consequents, called N-TS fuzzy model. Differently from the classical TS fuzzy technique with linear consequents, this N-TS fuzzy reformulation enables an effective use of differential mean value theorem to deal with unmeasured nonlinearities, which is known as a major challenge in TS fuzzy observer design. Moreover, the N-TS fuzzy form also allows reducing not only the design conservatism but also the numerical complexity of the design conditions as well as the observer structure, which is crucial for real-time vehicle application. To minimize the disturbance effect with an $\mathscr {H}_\infty$ performance and maximize the fault sensibility with an $\mathscr {H}_-$ performance, the a priori information on the disturbance/fault frequency ranges is taken into account in the N-TS fuzzy observer design via the generalized Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov (KYP) lemma. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, the design of the proposed multiobjective $\mathscr {H}_-/\mathscr {H}_\infty$ N-TS fuzzy fault detector is recast as an optimization problem with strict linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints, which can be effectively solved with numerical solvers. Both numerical and experiments are performed under realistic driving conditions to demonstrate the theoretical and practical interests of the new finite-frequency fuzzy fault detection method.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3204326","French Ministry of Higher Education and Research; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; ANR(grant numbers:ANR-19-CE22-0009); ANR(grant numbers:ANR-21-CE48-0021); Région Hauts-de-France; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62163002); Natural Science Foundation of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2021AAC05011); North Minzu University(grant numbers:ZDZX201902); Advanced Intelligent Perception and Control Technology Innovative Team of Ningxia; LAMIH laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9878085","Fault detection;linear matrix inequality;mixed   $\mathscr {H}_-/\mathscr {H}_\infty$   performance;steering faults;Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model;vehicle dynamics and estimation","Observers;Fault detection;Actuators;Estimation;Safety;Takagi-Sugeno model;Redundancy","","17","","47","IEEE","5 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there are still many challenges to be solved, and handling crowded roundabouts is one of them. This kind of scenario requires both safe and efficient maneuvers from the autonomous driving systems in order to maintain a proper traffic flow. This work presents a strategy to generate different speed profiles for a set of path candidates in order to obtain a merging maneuver according to current traffic scene. The proposed mechanism relies on the use of fictitious accelerations generated by leader and lag vehicles, incorporating by design comfort and safety bounds. The autonomous driving system proposed in this work was tested on realistic driving scenarios collected from public datasets and its performance was compared to human drivers on the same scenarios. The results showed in a variety of situations that the automated vehicle was capable of merging into roundabouts with tight merging gaps while maintaining both comfort and safety constraints.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2022.3211350","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación(grant numbers:PCI2019-103791); Community of Madrid through SEGVAUTO 4.0-CM Programme(grant numbers:S2018-EMT-4362); European Commission; Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership(grant numbers:826653); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9907889","Autonomous driving;merging algorithm;motion planning;roundabouts;speed profile;trajectory generation","Trajectory;Merging;Behavioral sciences;Safety;Planning;Roads;Autonomous vehicles","","11","","25","IEEE","3 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One main reason is the need to identify the uncountable potential situations in which the vehicle should be evaluated. Even when they are completely identified, the full-coverage of all these situations is not possible in real-world tests. Virtual validation however can be used to generate infinitesimally changing cases for testing. Nevertheless, the main challenge then becomes the collection and description of realistic test scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end approach for scenario generation from various sources. A flexible database structure enables fast and efficient querying that is used to generate an extensive set of test cases. The proposed schema is evaluated end-to-end-from scenario to test case generation to automated simulation and data gathering-populated by a data source based on the experience gained through real world tests.

An approach that has been pioneered in the automotive industry to assess the safe operation of these systems is scenario-based testing (SBT). While there is growing interest in employing SBT in other domains, it is often unclear whether it is economically feasible or applicable in a new domain and context, particularly for those practitioners without prior experience in SBT. A potentially unjustified application of SBT can undermine the approach's credibility. While previous papers have applied SBT to various systems, such as autonomous cars, ships, and aerial vehicles, they have not yet specified general criteria that qualify these systems for an application of SBT while disqualifying others. In this work, we present a methodological guideline that offers constructive assistance to prevent unsuitable use of SBT. First, we outline general, system-specific, and environment-specific criteria for determining the suitability of SBT. Then, we propose guiding questions for practitioners to aid them in deciding if SBT is suitable for their domain and guide them at the start of the realization phase.","2153-0017","979-8-3503-9946-2","10.1109/ITSC57777.2023.10422069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10422069","","Decision making;Behavioral sciences;Vehicle dynamics;Marine vehicles;Interviews;Intelligent transportation systems;Testing","","1","","48","IEEE","13 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The principle is to reconstruct the state vector and measurements of the system by sliding mode observers and compare the estimated outputs with those measured. In this work, a multi observer's technique is used. It consists on construction of many observers, at least one observer for each output (sensor measurement). Each observer must be robust to noises and to other uncertainties but sensitive to sensor faults. The residual is the estimation error witch is the difference between sensor measurement and its estimated. Without failure in the sensor, this residual remains around zero and if a fault is occurred, it deviates significantly from zero. This method is applied to an autonomous electric vehicle called RobuCar. Simulation results are given at the end to show the effectiveness of the approach.","","978-1-4244-3833-4","10.1109/ACTEA.2009.5227853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5227853","","Fault detection;Remotely operated vehicles;Mobile robots;Observers;Pollution measurement;Electric vehicles;Laboratories;Sensor systems;Redundancy;Navigation","","9","","12","IEEE","1 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We address this issue by introducing Aerialist (unmanned AERIAL vehicle teST bench), a novel UAV test bench, built on top of PX4 firmware, that facilitates or automates all the necessary steps of definition, generation, execution, and analysis of system-level UAV test cases in simulation environments. Moreover, it also supports parallel and scalable execution and analysis of test cases on Kubernetes clusters. This makes Aerialist a unique platform for research and development of test generation approaches for UAVs. To evaluate Aerialist's support for UAV developers in defining, generating, and executing UAV test cases, we implemented a search-based approach for generating realistic simulation-based test cases using real-world UAV flight logs.

The debate is whether autonomous vehicles are safe, yet more likely to strike a pedestrian of color than a person of white skin color. It is essential to obtain a greater understanding of the algorithmic bias that occurs during driving-centric object recognition. This research attempts to understand algorithmic bias that emerges during driving-centric object recognition. This project is opportune since several jurisdictions have recently permitted autonomous cars to run on public roads and several businesses are testing their AVs on public roads, often resulting in a notable number of fatalities. Autonomous systems are vulnerable to algorithmic bias because they do not need an active or passive person to identify and correct such biases. To reduce bias, design and implementation methodologies can be enhanced in accordance with new ethical norms. The aim is to continue efforts to reduce object detection bias that affects autonomous system decision-making to promote safety and increase technology adoption. Autonomous cars must evaluate safe operating options when a collision can't be prevented. This may persist due to the fluidity and unpredictability of human-automobile interactions. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are biased because to their reliance on data, individuals, and model design. Data bias has been connected to obstacles associated with the deployment of ethical AI and has detrimental effects on underrepresented demographic groups. This study addresses training data bias, algorithmic processing bias, transfer context bias, and interpretation bias. The first two biases relate to the computational aspects of the problem. The latter two relate to the improper deployment of algorithms and autonomous systems. If the training data are condition-specific, the model cannot make precise judgments in the actual world. This research studies and reviews strategies that would mitigate object detection biases in an autonomous vehicle system, specifically whether several simple building blocks used for research-grade pedestrian detection have comparable ability to detect pedestrians with cognitive and physical disabilities.","2834-8249","979-8-3503-5346-4","10.1109/IAICT62357.2024.10617839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10617839","machine learning;autonomous systems;object detection;decision-making bias;algorithmic bias;explainable AI;driverless cars;bias mitigation","Ethics;Pedestrians;Image color analysis;Roads;Computational modeling;Training data;Object detection","","1","","39","IEEE","13 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An overall testing accuracy of 96.8% is achieved including drives on unpaved roads whereas an optimum accuracy of 98.3% is achieved on city roads and highways with traffic delays due to congestion up to 10 minutes.","","978-1-7281-8337-4","10.1109/ICACCCN51052.2020.9362818","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9362818","Convolutional Neural Network;Autonomous driving;Artificial Intelligence;Deep Learning;Unpaved Path Drive","Rain;Roads;Urban areas;Autonomous automobiles;Convolutional neural networks;Autonomous vehicles;Testing","","1","","12","IEEE","1 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The core part of our training section, the Alexnet, underlies training a deep neuron network with high accuracy at a fast speed. Some techniques, like balancing data, are employed to avoid overfilling, thus improving the robustness and accuracy; other functions, such as speed control, are designed for emulating the reality more vividly.

However, their validation is mandatory before industrialization; testing every component should be assessed intensively in order to mitigate potential failures and avoid unwanted problems on the road. In order to cover all possible scenarios, virtual simulations are used to complement real-test driving and aid in the validation process. This paper focuses on the validation of the command law during realistic virtual simulations. Its aim is to detect the maximum amount of failures while exploring the input search space of the scenarios. A key industrial restriction, however, is to launch simulations as little as possible in order to minimize computing power needed. Thus, a reduced model based on a random forest model helps in decreasing the number of simulations launched. It accompanies the algorithm in detecting the maximum amount of faulty scenarios everywhere in the search space. The methodology is tested on a tracking vehicle use case, which produces highly effective results.","2378-1297","978-1-7281-0142-2","10.1109/ICCVE45908.2019.8965211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8965211","ADAS;autonomous driving;validation;optimization;machine learning","Connected vehicles;Computational modeling;Roads;Software algorithms;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Software","","6","","12","IEEE","23 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fault detection and diagnosis have always been important in maintaining AUV safety and reliability. In order to ensure that the AUVs can perform their tasks safely and effectively in a complex and unpredictable underwater environment, we propose a Transformer-based AUV fault diagnosis method (Trans-CNN), which can be used to accurately monitor and diagnose the status of the AUVs through sensor data. First, Trans-CNN adopts multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to realize local information learning of multivariate sensor data. Subsequently, considering the limitations of CNN global feature learning, Trans-CNN further introduces the Transformer architecture, which realizes the global feature encoding of multi-directional information by adopting a multi-head attention mechanism. Therefore, the proposed Trans-CNN fully integrates the advantages of CNN and Transformer in global and local feature learning so as to comprehensively extract valuable fault feature information of autonomous underwater vehicles. Experiments on real AUVs datasets show that this method can accurately and effectively monitor and diagnose the fault type of AUVs and has better performance than existing fault diagnosis methods. This confirms that the fault diagnosis method has the promise of practical deep-sea applications.","","979-8-3503-0594-4","10.1109/SRSE59585.2023.10336070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10336070","Autonomous underwater vehicles;Fault diagnosis;Transformer;Convolutional neural network","Fault diagnosis;Representation learning;Autonomous underwater vehicles;Uncertainty;Fault detection;Transformers;Feature extraction","","","","14","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, the testing adequacy of a DL system is usually measured by the accuracy of test data. Considering the limitation of accessible high quality test data, good accuracy performance on test data can hardly provide confidence to the testing adequacy and generality of DL systems.

Consider a scenario in which a slight perturbation in sensor data causes an autonomous vehicle to fail unexpectedly, potentially leading to accidents. Current testing methods often rely on computationally expensive active learning techniques to identify such vulnerabilities. Rather than actively training complex adversaries by interacting with the environment, there is a need to first intelligently find and reduce the search space to only those states where autonomous vehicles are found to be less confident. In this paper, we propose a black-box testing framework ReMAV that uses offline trajectories first to efficiently identify weaknesses of autonomous vehicles without the need for active interaction. To this end, we introduce a three-step methodology which i) uses offline state action pairs of any autonomous vehicle under test, ii) builds an abstract behavior representation using our designed reward modeling technique to analyze states with uncertain driving decisions, and iii) uses a disturbance model for minimal perturbation attacks where the driving decisions are less confident. Our reward modeling creates a behavior representation that highlights regions of likely uncertain autonomous vehicle behavior, even when performance seems adequate. This enables efficient testing without computationally expensive active adversarial learning. We evaluated ReMAV in a high-fidelity urban driving simulator across various single- and multi-agent scenarios. The results show substantial increases in failure events compared to the standard behavior of autonomous vehicles: 35% in vehicle collisions, 23% in road object collisions, 48% in pedestrian collisions, and 50% in off-road steering events. ReMAV outperforms two baselines and previous testing frameworks in effectiveness, efficiency, and speed of identifying failures. This demonstrates ReMAV’s capability to efficiently expose autonomous vehicle weaknesses using simple perturbation models.","2687-7813","","10.1109/OJITS.2024.3479098","Research Council of Norway through T3AS Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10714436","Autonomous vehicle testing;deep reinforcement learning;behavior modeling;inverse reinforcement learning","Testing;Autonomous vehicles;Trajectory;Closed box;Training;Perturbation methods;Pedestrians;Automobiles;Analytical models;Safety","","","","59","CCBY","11 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a recommended practice of the Verification and Validation (V&V) process of ISO/PAS 21448, a candidate standard for safety of the intended functionality for road vehicles, simulation-based testing has the potential to reduce both risks and costs. There is a growing body of research on devising test automation techniques using simulators for Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). However, how similar are the results if the same test scenarios are executed in different simulators? We conduct a replication study of applying a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) solution to a real-world ADAS (PeVi, a pedestrian vision detection system) using two different commercial simulators, namely, TASS/Siemens PreScan and ESI Pro-SiVIC. Based on a minimalistic scene, we compare critical test scenarios generated using our SBST solution in these two simulators. We show that SBST can be used to effectively generate critical test scenarios in both simulators, and the test results obtained from the two simulators can reveal several weaknesses of the ADAS under test. However, executing the same test scenarios in the two simulators leads to notable differences in the details of the test outputs, in particular, related to (1) safety violations revealed by tests, and (2) dynamics of cars and pedestrians. Based on our findings, we recommend future V&V plans to include multiple simulators to support robust simulation-based testing and to base test objectives on measures that are less dependant on the internals of the simulators.","2159-4848","978-1-7281-6836-4","10.1109/ICST49551.2021.00050","Vinnova; National Research Foundation of Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438594","search-based software testing;advanced driver-assistance systems;automotive simulators;replication","Software testing;Automation;Machine vision;Digital twin;Conferences;Particle measurements;Software","","21","","32","IEEE","24 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Practically, the number of testing scenarios permissible for a specific AV is severely limited by tight constraints on testing budgets and time. With the restrictions imposed by strictly restricted numbers of tests, existing testing methods often lead to significant uncertainty or difficulty to quantifying evaluation results. In this paper, we formulate this problem for the first time the ""few-shot testing"" (FST) problem and propose a systematic framework to address this challenge. To alleviate the considerable uncertainty inherent in a small testing scenario set, we frame the FST problem as an optimization problem and search for the testing scenario set based on neighborhood coverage and similarity. Specifically, under the guidance of better generalization ability of the testing scenario set on AVs, we dynamically adjust this set and the contribution of each testing scenario to the evaluation result based on coverage, leveraging the prior information of surrogate models (SMs). With certain hypotheses on SMs, a theoretical upper bound of evaluation error is established to verify the sufficiency of evaluation accuracy within the given limited number of tests. The experiment results on cut-in scenarios demonstrate a notable reduction in evaluation error and variance of our method compared to conventional testing methods, especially for situations with a strict limit on the number of scenarios.","2642-7214","979-8-3503-4881-1","10.1109/IV55156.2024.10588417","Beijing Nova Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10588417","Few-shot testing;autonomous vehicles;scenario coverage;testing scenario set","Accuracy;Uncertainty;Upper bound;Systematics;Size measurement;Search problems;Safety","","1","","31","IEEE","15 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inverse reinforcement learning is a principled methodology for deriving cost functions, but it requires high-quality expert demonstrations, which are expensive to obtain. Recently, scenario-based testing has emerged as a promising approach for validation of driving behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology that circumvents the need for costly expert driving demonstrations by harnessing scenario-based testing. Our Test-Driven Inverse Reinforcement Learning approach leverages Bayesian inference, utilizing the outcomes of scenario tests as observations to infer cost functions. We rigorously evaluate our method on simulated and real-world scenarios and demonstrate its ability to learn cost functions that successfully pass the respective scenario tests. We also show that the learned cost function generalizes well by also passing scenario tests from an unseen validation set and illustrate that few scenario tests are sufficient to learn meaningful cost functions. This innovative framework not only streamlines the cost function specification process but also offers a cost-effective and practical solution for advancing automated driving systems.","2642-7214","979-8-3503-4881-1","10.1109/IV55156.2024.10588652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10588652","","Intelligent vehicles;Reinforcement learning;Cost function;Complexity theory;Bayes methods;Testing","","","","31","IEEE","15 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study leverages high-fidelity experimental data collected over three standard drive cycles, UDDS, HWY and US06, intended to simulate a wide range of operating conditions. A method is developed to estimate the measurement uncertainties in fuel consumption for a test cycle, which occur due to the accumulation of measurement uncertainties propagated through the system. The uncertainty determination model uses statistical analysis and standard propagation techniques to evaluate and combine the uncertainties introduced from various sources (including the vehicle, chassis dynamometer, driver, and instrumentation). The analysis also examines three different experimental methods for determining the fuel consumption: 1) carbon mass balance, 2) volumetric fuel scale and 3) gravimetric fuel scale, and takes into consideration the properties of the instrumentation used. The results show that the most significant influence on the determination of the emissions comes from the concentration measurement, and similarly the biggest impact on the total fuel consumption uncertainty comes from the uncertainty in the determination of the carbon dioxide mass, due to the large presence of this pollutant in the overall emissions. It was found that the fuel consumption uncertainties are in the range of ±1-2% for all three methods analyzed, with the lowest values being obtained for measurements performed using the gravimetric method for all three drive cycles considered.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3222650","UChicago Argonne; Argonne National Laboratory; Argonne, A U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science Laboratory(grant numbers:DEAC02-06CH11357); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9973816","Measurement uncertainty;error analysis;chassis dynamometer testing;fuel economy","Measurement uncertainty;Uncertainty;Fuel economy;Fuels;Pollution measurement;Dynamometers;Testing","","3","","41","IEEE","7 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The purpose of the project is to contribute to this research by implementing a driving simulator for a device that can understand speed limit signs and make decisions that make the driver more comfortable and safer to drive. The CARLA Learning to Act (CARLA), an open-source autonomous test simulator consisting primarily of two modules, the CARLA simulator and the Python API module, is used as a simulator in this analysis. The algorithm You Look Just Once (YOLO) is used to classifying road signs. Yolo sees the whole picture during training and testing, encoding contextual information about the groups of objects and their appearances instead of a sliding window over several places in an image. This feature makes it extremely easy to analyze an image. Several utilities may be used to identify the speed signs of a road.

To address this problem, we introduce referentially transparent inputs (RTIs), a simple, widely applicable methodology for validating machine translation software.

However, safety assurances for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are lacking under adverse weather conditions and in unseen road environments. Unfortunately, real-world testing of AVs in such situations can be unsafe and even infeasible. Reproducing any failure cases with identical external operating conditions is practically impossible. Specifically, situations like heavy rain, low-lighting conditions, and work zones require considerable time and effort. To address this problem, we propose CoSim, a co-simulation architecture for testing of AV perception in adverse operating conditions. We specifically use the general framework of CoSim to interface CMU's autonomous software stack called CADRE with an open-source simulator named CARLA. CoSim is designed such that the AV software stack interacts with realistic simulated driving scenarios as in the real world. Using CoSim, we mimic the use of cameras and LIDARs for the real-time detection of road objects and work zones under adverse operating conditions. CoSim supports time virtualization on both CADRE and CARLA to accommodate heavy processing demands. Using CoSim, we evaluate the performance of our AV in adverse operating conditions, dramatically reducing the need for expensive real-world testing.","2153-0017","979-8-3503-9946-2","10.1109/ITSC57777.2023.10422355","US Department of Transportation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10422355","","Roads;Full stack;Real-time systems;Safety;Virtualization;Autonomous vehicles;Testing","","1","","26","IEEE","13 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These patterns are described in test protocols, e.g. from certifications, ratings and standards. Since proving ground operators possess only a confined space to provide these scenarios, solutions like agile alteration of road marking patterns are advisable. Furthermore, a high precision is necessary to comply with the specifications from the test protocols and to enable a high test-reproducibility. To achieve these goals mobile robots that follow determined trajectories can be used for pre-marking. Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning can facilitate a high accuracy. Since proving ground operators or their users commonly have access to automated vehicles such as passenger cars or robotic target platforms, I recommend utilizing these for highly accurate pre-marking for temporary maneuver markings on test tracks. In order to test this concept, a truck equipped with GPS, UHF, LTE antennas, a driving controller and a pre-marking apparatus, was setup to follow predetermined trajectories on the Mercedes-Benz proving ground in Immendingen, Germany. Measurements of the specified pre-marked lane width returned mean accuracies of 98.74 and 99.72 % for two individual maneuver markings. Due to a pre-marking velocity of 4 m/s, the time needed to apply the pre-marker is low. The results indicate application potentials for proving ground operators and testing service providers.","2378-1297","978-1-6654-1687-0","10.1109/ICCVE52871.2022.9743020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743020","automated vehicles;global positioning system;road markings;testing","Protocols;Target tracking;Roads;UHF measurements;UHF antennas;Real-time systems;Trajectory","","4","","27","IEEE","30 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lane detection is one of the foremost tasks for vehicles, with a direct impact on driving decisions. Lane detection is a crucial component of autonomous driving, working in conjunction with lane centering control (LCC) and adaptive cruise control (ACC) to enable advanced driving assistance functions. At first thought, lane detection may seem immune to attacks. However, is this really the case? In this paper, we conduct experiments on lane detection modules and reveal their susceptibility to attacks exploiting hypersensitivity. Specifically, an excessively sensitive lane detector may mistake small markings for valid lanes, causing the vehicle to follow the wrong path. Through experiments, we demonstrate the vulnerability of lane detection models to adversarial attacks, even under black-box conditions where a change in one pixel can induce errors. We discuss the contrast between gradient-based and heuristic search-based optimization methods for black-box attacks and demonstrate the superiority of heuristic approaches for this task. Leveraging particle swarm optimization (PSO), we carry out lane detection attacks to address the research gap for black-box lane attacks.","","979-8-3503-6036-3","10.1109/AIHCIR61661.2023.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10505384","lane detection;black-box attacks;PSO","Lane detection;Roads;Closed box;Detectors;Safety;Security;Task analysis","","","","21","IEEE","29 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, we tested whether avatar personalization and motor control could impact moral decision-making, physiological reactions and reaction times, as well as embodiment, presence and avatar perception. Seventeen participants, who had their personalized avatars created in a previous study, took part in a range of incongruent (i.e., harmful action led to better overall outcomes) and congruent (i.e., harmful action led to trivial outcomes) moral dilemmas as the drivers of a semi-autonomous car. They embodied four different avatars (counterbalanced - personalized motor control, personalized no motor control, generic motor control, generic no motor control). Overall, participants took a utilitarian approach by performing harmful actions only to maximize outcomes. We found increased physiological arousal (SCRs and heart rate) for personalized avatars compared to generic avatars, and increased SCRs in motor control conditions compared to no motor control. Participants had slower reaction times when they had motor control over their avatars, possibly hinting at more elaborate decision-making processes. Presence was also higher in motor control compared to no motor control conditions. Embodiment ratings were higher for personalized avatars, and generally, personalization and motor control were perceptually positive features. These findings highlight the utility of personalized avatars and open up a range of future research possibilities that could benefit from the affordances of this technology and simulate, more closely than ever, real-life action.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2024.3372121","Bristol and Bath Creative R&D funded by the AHRC Creative Industries Cluster Programme(grant numbers:AH/S002936/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10458355","Human-centered computing-Empirical studies in HCI;Virtual reality;Usability testing","Ethics;Avatars;Motor drives;Decision making;Automobiles;Electronic mail;Vehicles","Humans;Avatar;Autonomous Vehicles;Decision Making;Computer Graphics;Morals","","","79","IEEE","4 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the complicated attack behavior, a hidden semi-Markov process is introduced where only the observed attack modes emitted by the inaccessible ones are available. The probability density functions of sojourn time and the semi-Markov kernel are adopted to help analyze the combined fault detection and consensus control system. Sufficient conditions on the σ-error mean square stability of MASs with mixed H∞ /H- performance are established by using a set of Lyapunov functions that depend on the hidden and the observed attack modes.

To resolve such limitations, we propose a traffic sensory data classification paradigm based on quantifying the scenario complexity for each roadway segment, where such quantification is jointly based on road semantic complexity and traffic element complexity. The road semantic complexity is a proposed measurement of the complexity incurred by the static elements such as curvy roads, intersections, merges and splits, which is predicted with a Support Vector Regression (SVR).

This paper shows how statistical matching (SM) can be applied to fuse different categorial accident and traffic observation databases. Hereby, the fusion is demonstrated in two use cases, each featuring several fusion methods. In use case 1, a synthetic database was generated out of two accident data samples, whereby 78.7% of the original values could be estimated correctly by a random forest classifier. The same fusion using distance-hot-deck reproduced only 67% of the original values, but better preserved the marginal distributions. A real-world application is illustrated in use case 2, where accident data was fused with over 23,000 car trajectories at one intersection in Germany.

The converter employs GaN device as the primary switch due to its better figure-of-merit, while using Si device as protection switch due to superior short-circuit immunity. In this paper, the QSW operation mode and a multi-phase structure are combined to achieve enhanced efficiency and fault tolerance. The switching-node voltage during the dead-time intervals is used as the short-circuit fault signature. The adaptive post-fault control utilizes a PLL-based synchronization method in a closed daisy-chain arrangement to: 1) guarantee QSW operation mode regardless of the variable switching frequency due to the inductance value tolerance, and 2) automatically adjust the interleaving phase shifts between phases following a fault detection.

Since the fuel/energy consumption patterns for ICEVs, BEVs, and HEVs differ significantly with respect to driving cycles, this study selects appropriate fuel/energy consumption models for each vehicle powertrain. The proposed vehicle speed controller computes energy-optimized trajectories to assist vehicles in traversing signalized intersections. A single signalized intersection is simulated using the microscopic simulation software INTEGRATION to systematically test the performance of the Eco-CACC-I system for different combinations of factors (powertrain, congestion level, CAV MPR). The test results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle speed controller produces up to 18.9%, 23.8%, and 9.0% fuel/energy savings for ICEVs, BEVs, and HEVs, respectively.

PolyVerif, an open-source validation and verification framework, is designed to accelerate research in this area. PolyVerif presents a comprehensive open-source validation and verification stack, including an autonomous vehicle engine, symbolic test generation, simulation at different fidelity levels, a digital twin creation environment, and a process for transitioning from simulation tests to physical tests. One of the key challenges for the validation and verification of autonomous vehicles is to construct a modular design for the test flows. Modular validation is critical to building an inductive argument for system correctness. Today, these techniques are not easily available to validation researchers or engineers due to the lack of visibility into the internals of an autonomous vehicle stack and the lack of standard definitions for these interface points. The realm of open-source allows for both visibility and experimentation to develop these very important interfaces. This paper introduces PolyFlows, the modular ""Design for Test"" framework in PolyVerif, focused on the main pieces of the complex autonomous vehicle stack: Detection, Location Services, Control, and Path Planning. PolyFlows creates open-source modular validation structures that can be used to check the precision of the intricate autonomous vehicle stack.

Still, assessing the strength of tests for such systems is an open and complex problem. A central component of an ADS is the Path Planner, which is in charge of computing the trajectory of the autonomous vehicle. It bases its decisions on several aspects such as safety, traffic regulations, comfort, etc. These aspects can be linked to weights in a weighted cost function that ranks potential trajectories to be followed. Weight coverage has been proposed as a test criterion for tests of this type of path planner. Weight coverage measures how much the different weights (and thus the aspects they are linked to) are involved in the decisions taken by the path planner in a test scenario. All weights should be involved in at least one test. Although weight coverage has shown to be a reasonable criterion, it does not provide a clear way to drive the generation of new scenarios. In this paper, we propose a search-based approach for generating scenarios for achieving weight coverage. We introduce two variants of the approach; the first one tries to generate a scenario covering a given single weight, while the second one tries to generate scenarios covering as many weights as possible at the same time. We experimented with these approaches using the path planner provided by our industry partner, and we show that they are able to generate scenarios that cover all the weights.","","978-1-7281-8558-3","10.1109/ICECCS51672.2020.00018","Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:13/RC/2094); Irish Research Council(grant numbers:GOIPG/201711829); ERATO HASUO Metamathematics for Systems Design(grant numbers:JPMJERI603); JST(grant numbers:10.13039/501100009024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9376191","search-based testing;mutation analysis;autonomous driving;path planner;weight coverage","Weight measurement;Industries;Regulation;Trajectory;Safety;Test pattern generators;Autonomous vehicles","","13","","23","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Investigating when, why, and how these vehicles fail is integral to preventing future recurrences of these kinds of incidents. By gathering these accidents, their associated data, and simulating them, it is possible to identify the major reasons for the accident as well as allowing for the testing and verification of autonomous vehicles (AVs), before they encounter the real world. This knowledge can then be further refined for the purposes of establishing a set of standards for AV safety and capabilities. This paper proposes a novel system for crash scenario generation which works based on actual AV crashes. In addition, there does not yet exist a cloud based database for housing AV crashes, locations, and descriptions. Furthermore, there also does not exist an automated system that creates simulated testing scenarios based on real AV crashes. Our proposed algorithm checks the AV crash location and designs virtual roads from map data about the crash location, retrieved from Open Street Maps. Then it is planned to use natural language processing (NLP) to generate the crash scenario based on the crash description. The virtual scenario, which includes real features of roads – such as curvature, number of lanes, and speed limits – will be used to test AVs. Another portion of the proposed system will allow for important features to be extracted automatically from these crashes, which will be used for improving the road designs capable of addressing AV’s needs.","1558-058X","978-1-7281-6861-6","10.1109/SoutheastCon44009.2020.9368284","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9368284","Accident Recreation;Car Crash Analysis;Automatic Scenario Generation;Road improvement and Testing;Autonomous Vehicles","Roads;Feature extraction;Natural language processing;Safety;Autonomous vehicles;Accidents;Testing","","9","","44","IEEE","25 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast, the current study used EEG data from these previous experiments to determine the quality of support vector machine (SVM) predictions as a first step toward realizing a brain–computer interface (BCI) for emergency braking. Power spectral density (PSD) features were extracted from the EEG of one electrode to train and evaluate an SVM. Through a novel data ablation analysis, the optimal number of PSD components was determined to optimize model classification quality measured by the area under the curve (AUC). A comparison of the proposed model to the previous RLDA and other machine learning (ML) methods indicated that the SVM had a superior AUC.

Due to the limitations of the hardware and software, it is very difficult for autonomous cars to detect the full range of system potential faults by themselves. Each car has weaknesses. The cars may encounter different defects such as outdated software, malfunction of sensors, etc. We found that we can take advantage of Condorcet's jury theorem to solve the problem: “juries consisting of many individuals are likely to reach better decisions than single experts”. To implement the idea, we proposed a self-reflection algorithm by using P2P benchmarking, so that autonomous cars can proactively diagnose their system performance regularly, and detect all potential faults by using the collective views of peers.

However, due to the lack of realistic background traffic, scenarios in closed-course tests are usually static and limited. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a new safety assessment framework, which integrates cooperative speed optimization of multiple traffic participants and active conflict generation along the reference path.

When planning tasks to be done by multi-autonomous vehicles in an enclosed area with a known dynamic map (i.e. bi-directional path network), there are many issues that have not yet been comprehensively solved. The real world presents more complexity than the initial algorithms addressed. There are problems that occur due to interaction with the real-world. This means autonomous vehicles can stop, are affected, or face problems, and hence tasks and vehicles' paths and motion need to be replanned. In order to replan, a greater understanding of the state of vehicles, the state of the map, and importantly the importance of tasks and vehicles is definitely needed. This paper explores the improvements made to replanning by gaining a thorough understanding of the map and then utilising map information to make the best, most efficient replanning decision. Five replanning methods are investigated and four options which combine the methods in different ways are tested in this research. A map analysis method is also presented.

One straightforward approach is to train the models directly on labeled synthetic datasets. However, this approach usually fails to achieve generality, owing to the domain bias between the real and fake databases of images. We therefore, propose a novel architecture that produces synthetic images based on cycle consistency, in the absence of labeled pair of images. We test the object detectors Detectron and SSD on four types of curated benchmark datasets to evaluate their robustness in detecting objects such as cars, bikes, and pedestrians on road. The four benchmark datasets contain a diversified set of image corruptions and a few variations are built using the proposed framework such as weather variations. The four datasets are PASCAL VOC and SYNTHIA dataset images, weather-translated images, variation-augmented images, and stylized renderings using Adain style transfer. After conducting extensive investigations, we observe a decreased classification loss when exposed to variable image quality. We also witness that augmenting the training datasets with variations in the wild aided in boosting the generalizing capability of the object detectors.

Nevertheless, continual learning presents an additional challenge for both centralized and federated training, as updating models with novel datasets may induce the forgetting of previously acquired samples, thereby diminishing the model’s versatility.

This is then followed by the formulation of operational fault tolerant control that realizes the collaborative fault tolerance functionality at CAVs operational level in response to possible individual vehicle faults, where detailed modelling using vehicle movement dynamics will be described together with the construction of fast fault diagnosis and a collaborative fault tolerant control algorithm. A simple example will be given as well to demonstrate the proposed algorithm together with the discussions on other issues such as randomness of the system, communication errors and full energy consideration. These leads to several future directions of the research for the traffic flow control of non-signalized intersections with 100% penetration of CAVs.","2325-0690","978-1-7281-6530-1","10.1109/ICAMechS49982.2020.9310093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9310093","Intersectional signal control;Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs);Fault diagnosis;Fault tolerant control;Simulation","Fault tolerant control;Collaboration;Vehicle dynamics;Fault diagnosis;Mathematical model;Fault tolerant systems;Trajectory","","1","","22","IEEE","6 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been applied to effectively modify the dynamic objects of the environment (e.g., pedestrians and other vehicles), also known as Non-Playable Characters (NPCs). However, existing RL approaches implement centralized controllers of the environment, resulting in possibly unrealistic and even invalid behaviors of the NPCs. In this paper, we propose to model NPCs as independent and fully autonomous agents to challenge the ADS under test (i.e., the ego ADS). In the first step of our approach, we train an adversarial ADS by designing a reward function as a linear combination of two components: (1) a component that encourages it to drive well in the given driving scenario, and (2) an adversarial component, that smoothly guides the agent towards a collision with the ego ADS. In our second step, we resume training of the ego ADS, to increase its robustness towards the behaviors of the adversarial ADS. Our experiments on a highway driving scenario show that the adversarial ADS is significantly more effective at generating collisions of the ego ADS than a random baseline. Moreover, adversarial retraining induces safe behaviors of the ego ADS, preventing the adversarial ADS from colliding.","2159-4848","979-8-3503-0818-1","10.1109/ICST60714.2024.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10638566","Autonomous Driving;Reinforcement Learning;Adversarial Testing","Training;Software testing;Road transportation;Pedestrians;Reinforcement learning;Robustness;Autonomous agents","","1","","46","IEEE","27 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the complexity and variability of environmental information, the perception module is prone to generating fault information and transmitting it to the planning control module. This can lead to erroneous decisions and control commands by the planning control module, ultimately causing accidents. Therefore, it is crucial to test the tolerance of the planning control module to fault information. This paper proposes an event-driven fault injection testing framework that can dynamically inject various types of faults based on different fault trigger conditions in the scenario.

The current industrial practice is to manually create test scenarios, manually or automatically execute these scenarios using simulators, and manual evaluation of the outcomes. A fundamental part of system-level testing of such systems is the simulation of environmental context. The test scenarios typically consist of setting certain environment conditions and testing the system under test in these settings.

These tools will be required to provide system loading, error injection, introducing delays, and to test system redundancy and resiliency to errors. New tools will be required to support, development, subsystem validation, and traffic generation during system testing. Moreover, these tools will continue to be used long after the system is fielded to support regression testing, certification, and maintenance.","2155-4951","1-4244-1215-3","10.1109/ICNSURV.2007.384160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272192","","Surveillance;Certification;System testing;Radar;Next generation networking;Delay;Redundancy;Network topology;Data analysis;Computerized monitoring","","1","","","IEEE","16 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their usage was proposed for several domains, such as safety validation, verification, testing, and systems engineering. While those domains are key for a successful development from the technical and systems perspective, the maturity of the technology continuously evolves. This generates the need for a suitable product management in order to realize a successful market entry. We propose, to extend scenario-based development by a product scope description incorporating the business value and development costs for each scenario. The definition of a product on scenario level leads to the questions, how scenarios interdepend from an architectural and technological perspective and how to derive an efficient development order. We therefore introduce scenario dependency graphs, which we assess to be a valuable communication instrument. These graphs can additionally support project planning, monitoring, and control leading to an increased development efficiency and supporting project management towards market entry.","","978-1-7281-5394-0","10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9575607","","Costs;Uncertainty;Systematics;Project management;Product development;Planning;Safety;Monitoring;Business;Testing","","","","19","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We use multi-objective search to guide testing towards the most critical behaviors of ADAS. Surrogate modeling enables our testing approach to explore a larger part of the input search space within limited computational resources. We characterize the condition under which the multi-objective search algorithm behaves the same with and without surrogate modeling, thus showing the accuracy of our approach. We evaluate our approach by applying it to an industrial ADAS system. Our experiment shows that our approach automatically identifies test cases indicating critical ADAS behaviors.

This article proposes a novel virtual-to-real driving (VRDriving) framework based on adversarial learning, which is able to transfer the ability of end-to-end learning models trained by simulation virtual data sets to the real world. The framework consists of three parts: 1) an end-to-end learning-based estimator with the cost-sensitive loss function for driving commands estimation; 2) an encoder for extracting the driving domain features from unlabeled real driving images; and 3) a discriminator for distinguishing whether the virtual driving domain features are real or fake. The above three modules can be trained simultaneously. With such a novel learning framework, the driving domain features encoded from the real images are closer to the driving domain features inside the end-to-end estimator via adversarial learning mechanism. Three experiments show the proposed VRDriving framework performs the state-of-the-art estimation accuracy of the steering command than several baselines and other typical frameworks.

The topology, herein called the Zonal Road Topology, consists of unidirectional loops of road with traffic flowing either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Adjacent loops are directionally aligned with one another, allowing vehicles to transfer from one loop to another through a simple lane change. To evaluate the Zonal Road Topology, a one km2 pilot-track near Changshu, China is currently being set aside for testing. In parallel, traffic simulations are being performed. To this end, we conduct a simulation-based comparison between the Zonal Road Topology and a traditional road topology for a generic Electric Vehicle (EV) using the Simulation for Urban MObility (SUMO) platform and MATLAB/Simulink. We analyze the topologies in terms of their travel efficiency, safety, energy usage, and capacity. Drive time, number of halts, progress rate, and other metrics are analyzed across varied traffic levels to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the Zonal Road Topology. Our results indicate that vehicles on the Zonal Road Topology have a lower, more consistent drive time, make more progress, and halt less frequently, while using less energy on average.

Firstly, Siamese network is used to generate representation space for homogeneous samples. After the training of Siamese network, a feature index table is generated. Secondly, the recognition of traffic signs is completed by a two-stage model. The detected traffic sign regions are roughly classified into three categories, namely “Indication”, “Warning”, and “Prohibition”, and then the three categories of traffic sign are fine-grained classified by using similarity measure model. Experimental results show that our proposed model improves the accuracy of small traffic signs in the wild, and realizes the fast detection and recognition of traffic signs.","","978-1-6654-0757-1","10.1109/ICICSP54369.2021.9611856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9611856","traffic sign recognition;intelligent transportation;attention;inception;similarity measure","Training;Signal processing;Benchmark testing;Safety;Indexes","","","","21","IEEE","25 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the field of transportation, these advancements empower autonomous systems to precisely perceive their surroundings, make swift and secure decisions, and operate seamlessly without human intervention. In the case of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), the perception phase, involving tasks like road surface extraction and on-road object detection, is crucial. While AVs offer benefits like improved road safety, convenience, and efficiency, they grapple with the “black box” challenge, symbolizing the opacity of their decision-making processes to humans. This absence of transparency poses acceptance, regulatory, ethical, and security issues. To tackle these challenges, our work leverages Concept Relevance Propagation (CRP), a bias-resistant Relevance-Based (RB) eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithm to proffer transparent concept - level explanations to the behavior of object detection models used in AVs, for traffic perception. CRP goes beyond traditional attribution maps, by generating explanations that automatically identifies and visualizes relevant concepts within the input space. This insight sheds light on the crucial areas responsible for the behavior of object detection models used in AVs. This research aims to boost transparency, trust, and understanding in the field of AVs, fostering safer and more widely accepted autonomous systems.","1558-058X","979-8-3503-1710-7","10.1109/SoutheastCon52093.2024.10500215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10500215","Autonomous Vehicles;eXplainable Artificial Intelligence;Object Detection;Concept Relevance Propagation","Visualization;Explainable AI;Transportation;Object detection;Robustness;Road safety;Regulation","","","","29","IEEE","24 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper therefore, we provide an overview of metamorphic testing as well as an implementation in the autonomous systems domain.

To test DNNs, diverse inputs are needed to trigger mis-predictions. Some preliminary works use byte-level mutations or domain-specific filters (e.g., foggy), whose enabled mutations may be limited and likely error-prone. State-of-the-art (SOTA) works employ deep generative models to generate (infinite) inputs. Also, to keep the mutated inputs perceptually valid (e.g., a cat remains a “cat” after mutation), existing efforts rely on imprecise and less generalizable heuristics. This study revisits two key objectives in media input mutation — perception diversity (Div) and validity (Val) — in a rigorous manner based on manifold, a well-developed theory capturing perceptions of high-dimensional media data in a low-dimensional space. We show important results that Div and Val inextricably bound each other, and prove that SOTA generative model-based methods fundamentally fail to mutate real-world media data (either sacrificing Div or Val). In contrast, we discuss the feasibility of mutating real-world media data with provably high Div and Val based on manifold. Following, we concretize the technical solution of mutating media data of various formats (images, audios, text) via a unified manner based on manifold. Specifically, when media data are projected into a low-dimensional manifold, the data can be mutated by walking on the manifold with certain directions and step sizes. When contrasted with the input data, the mutated data exhibit encouraging Div in the perceptual traits (e.g., lying vs. standing dog) while retaining reasonably high Val (i.e., a dog remains a dog). We implement our techniques in DeepWalk for testing DNNs. DeepWalk constructs manifolds for media data offline. In online testing, DeepWalk walks on manifolds to generate mutated media data with provably high Div and Val. Our evaluation tests DNNs executing various tasks (e.g., classification, self-driving, machine translation) and media data of different types (image, audio, text). DeepWalk outperforms prior methods in terms of the testing comprehensiveness and can find more error-triggering inputs with higher quality. The tested DNNs, after repaired using DeepWalk's findings, exhibit better accuracy.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2024.3370807","RGC GRF(grant numbers:16214723); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10462634","Deep learning testing;deep neural networks;metamorphic testing","Media;Testing;Manifolds;Dogs;Legged locomotion;Convolutional neural networks;Training","","1","","97","IEEE","7 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These systems must be capable of navigating a variety of challenging conditions that could occur during autonomous driving, including natural hazards such as heavy precipitation or raindrops obscuring the camera lens. As a result, it is of utmost importance that these perception systems undergo rigorous testing against these potential hazards, a requirement enforced by many countries’ regulatory bodies for human-operated vehicles. However, given the multitude of potential hazard scenarios, each with its own set of adjustable parameters, two significant challenges arise. The first challenge is to devise a systematic and comprehensive method for testing autonomous vehicles against these hazard scenarios, with quantifiable results. The second challenge involves efficiently navigating the vast search space to pinpoint scenarios that could potentially lead to system failure.In our research, we present HazardTesting, a framework for generating a diverse, customizable hazard catalogue for autonomous vehicle perception evaluation. This tool not only measures an AV’s hazard testing coverage but also identifies critical adversarial hazards via optimization procedures.

The standard approach of testing robustness through fault detection is directly stimulating the system and detecting violations of the system requirements. Our approach differs by instead running the autonomous system through full missions in a simulated environment and measuring performance based on high-level mission criteria. The result is a method of searching for challenging scenarios for an autonomous system under test that exercise a variety of performance modes. We utilize adaptive sampling to intelligently search the state space for test scenarios which exist on the boundary between distinct performance modes.

One prevailing way is to design testing scenarios using prior knowledge of CAVs, test CAVs in these scenarios, and then evaluate their safety performances. However, significant differences between CAVs and prior knowledge could severely reduce the evaluation efficiency. Towards addressing this issue, most existing studies focus on the adaptive design of testing scenarios during the CAV testing process, but so far they cannot be applied to high-dimensional scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the adaptive safety performance evaluation by leveraging the testing results, after the CAV testing process. It can significantly improve the evaluation efficiency and be applied to high-dimensional scenarios. Specifically, instead of directly evaluating the unknown quantity (e.g., crash rates) of CAV safety performances, we evaluate the differences between the unknown quantity and known quantity (i.e., control variates). By leveraging the testing results, the control variates could be well-designed and optimized such that the differences are close to zero, so the evaluation variance could be dramatically reduced for different CAVs. To handle the high-dimensional scenarios, we propose the sparse control variates method, where the control variates are designed only for the sparse and critical variables of scenarios. According to the number of critical variables in each scenario, the control variates are stratified into strata and optimized within each stratum using multiple linear regression techniques. We justify the proposed method’s effectiveness by rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical study of high-dimensional overtaking scenarios.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3317078","National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2021YFB2501200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62133002); Tsinghua-Toyota Joint Research Fund(grant numbers:20223930089); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10265755","Adaptive safety evaluation;connected and automated vehicles;sparse control variates;high-dimensional scenarios","Testing;Safety;Accidents;Life estimation;Costs;Automation","","4","","41","IEEE","27 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

ADS-B provides a variety of benefits such as air-to-air surveillance capability, real-time traffic and aeronautical information in the cockpit, surveillance to remote or inhospitable areas that do not currently have coverage with radar and so on. Prototype ADS-B Test-bed was developed in Taean airport to apply a surveillance function of ADS-B and to evaluate performance of the ADS-B system. Under the developed ADS-B Test-bed, an aircraft periodically broadcasts its own state vector and other information without manual operation. ADS-B equipped aircraft or surface vehicles can receive the data through digital data-links such as VDL mode 4, UAT and 1090 MHz Extended Squitter. Air traffic information from ADS-B non-equipped aircrafts can not be transmitted since ADS-B is dependent surveillance upon the suitable navigation and broadcast capability such as GPS and the digital data-links. Traffic Information Service - Broadcast (TIS-B) provides surveillance data from secondary surveillance sources for ADS-B non-equipped aircrafts. In this paper, radar data processing is explained in detail and preliminary results to design prototype TIS-B server are described. Data fusion architecture and practical implementation concepts of TIS-B server are also explained.

The challenging task is to deal with steering signals at high speeds and to manage the vehicle's velocity with significant changes in steering signals. In order to reach a destination with optimized time and stable trajectory, an autonomous vehicle system should utilize steering control and velocity signal in constraints. In this article, we propose a recommendation system based on Fuzzy logic and Deep Steering Neural Networks. Convolution neural networks(CNNs) works as a front-end stage for predicting steering control, and fuzzy logic in a back-end stage works as natural inferences for recommending velocity and adapting new steering control. The front-end stage uses CNNs with the input from raw sensory data, and the output extracts steering control prediction that feeds forward to the back-end stage. Key functions of back-end stage combine a number of dynamic vehicle information including, steering prediction to extract more effective steering control, and velocity for the autonomous car. The convolution neural network was trained on the Udacity driving datasheet with a number of hours of training and testing data, and the all system is built on MATLAB with GPU coder.","","978-89-93215-16-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8571590","Autonomous vehicle;Convolution neural network;Deep steering;Fuzzy logic","Fuzzy logic;Automobiles;Autonomous automobiles;Neural networks;Convolution;Control systems;Training","","","","13","","13 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such systems must be thoroughly tested and validated before being deployed in the real world to avoid such events. Testing in open-world scenarios can be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. These challenges can be addressed by using driving simulators such as CARLA instead. A key part of such tests is adversarial testing, in which the goal is to find scenarios that lead to failures of the given system. While several independent efforts in testing have been made, a well-established testing framework that enables adversarial testing has yet to be made available for CARLA. We therefore propose ANTI-CARLA, an automated testing framework in CARLA for simulating adversarial weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain) and sensor faults (e.g., camera occlusion) that fail the system. The operating conditions in which a given system should be tested are specified in a scenario description language. The framework offers an efficient search mechanism that searches for adversarial operating conditions that will fail the tested system. In this way, ANTI-CARLA extends the CARLA simulator with the capability of performing adversarial testing on any given driving pipeline. We use ANTI-CARLA to test the driving pipeline trained with Learning By Cheating (LBC) approach. The simulation results demonstrate that ANTI-CARLA can effectively and automatically find a range of failure cases despite LBC reaching an accuracy of 100% in the CARLA benchmark.","","978-1-6654-6880-0","10.1109/ITSC55140.2022.9921776","DARPA; Air Force Research Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921776","","Training;Rain;Monte Carlo methods;Simulation;Pipelines;Reinforcement learning;Vehicle dynamics","","10","","36","IEEE","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, recent research has highlighted a number of reliability concerns associated with deep neural networks (DNNs) used for DL. In particular, hardware-level reliability of DNNs is of concern when DL models are mapped to specialized neuromorphic hardware such as memristor-based crossbars. Faults in the crossbars can deviate the corresponding DNN model weights from their trained values. It is therefore desirable to have an on-device ""checksum"" function to indicate if model weights are deviated. We present a backdooring technique that fine-tunes DNN weights to implement the checksum function. The backdoored checksum function is triggered only when inferencing is carried out using a special set of data points with watermarks. We show that backdooring, i.e., fine-tuning of DNN weights, has no impact on the inferencing accuracy of the original DNN model. Moreover, the implemented checksum functions for AlexNet and VGG-16 remarkably outperform baseline approaches. Based on the proposed on-line functional testing solution, we present a computing framework that can efficiently recover the inferencing accuracy of a memristor-mapped DNN from weight deviations. Compared to related recent work, the proposed framework achieves 5.6 × speed-up in time-to-recovery and reduces the on-chip test data volume by 99.99%.","2378-2250","978-1-6654-1695-5","10.1109/ITC50571.2021.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9611319","","Deep learning;Training;Degradation;Neuromorphics;Memristors;Watermarking;Hardware","","6","","30","IEEE","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The only way to efficiently achieve this amount of tests in a timely manner is by using simulations and high fidelity virtual environments. Two key components of being able to test an automated system in a synthetic environment are validated sensor models and noise models for each sensor technology. In fact, the sensors are the element feeding information into the system in order to enable it to safely plan the trajectory and navigate.

Metrics describing the criticality are necessary to automatically identify the critical situations and scenarios from measurement data.

Amid the intense application of the technology, however lies a growing user concern and interest in insights and decisions made by a classifier due to the increasingly complex models known for hiding crucial information regarding their outcome generation. Overreliance in model performance therefore can no longer be considered a sure metric to model performance due to the underlying trust issues and therefore the need for model interpretation or explanation to extend and make machine models potential sources of knowledge. This research paper delves into the understanding of the various approaches to successful model interpretation, further proposing enhancement of Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explainer (LIME) via ‘Calculus Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explainer’ (C-LIME) as an intuitive approach to black-box ML model interpretation.

Insight into the different workforce profiles of green and traditional energy supply chains is critical to manage impacts to workers in traditional energy occupations and to identify what skills and occupations are needed in green energy jobs. The role and skills descriptions captured in big datasets of online job ads have the potential to deliver these insights but considerable time and effort is required to train algorithms to differentiate job ads pertaining to traditional and green energy occupations. In addition, algorithms usually need to be developed for each dataset of interest whereas lexicon-based approaches can be adapted relatively easily. In this study, we illustrate the use of explainable AI techniques (in combination with a set of initial keywords) to build a lexicon that can be used to identify (with 82% precision rate) traditional and green energy job ads across the supply chain (from energy production to energy policy, regulation and sales). Our study demonstrates the XAI-enhanced lexicon’s efficacy in uncovering differences in the industry, occupation, and geographic profile of traditional and green energy job ads.

Remedial Action Schemes (RAS) and Advanced Defense Schemes (ADS) have emerged as solutions to meet this requirement. In order to ensure the stability of the power system, it is essential to test the ADS before its implementation. Various testing methods are discussed, including simulation software testing, static open-loop testing, and dynamic testing using realtime simulators such as Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS). In the context of dynamic testing of ADS in Indonesia, a notable issue arises, the financial requirements associated with testing ADS developments using the RTDS create difficulties in terms of accessibility and utilization, limiting dynamic testing of ADS. The implementation of ADS by PLN units solely based on software simulation results that have not undergone RTDS dynamic testing poses significant risks. This can lead to potential failures or inadequate performance in critical situations. PLN Pusertif, as a Testing and Certification Institution within PLN Holding, plays a significant role in ensuring the quality of equipment used in the PLN power system and possesses an RTDS laboratory. This paper further explores the RTDS dynamic testing process conducted by PLN Pusertif for ADS, focusing on the case of PLN UIP2B Jamali and its implementation in multiple subsystems. The results of the dynamic testing demonstrate that the ADS design algorithms can effectively secure the power system from faults in each subsystem. This comprehensive testing approach plays a crucial role in the development and validation of the ADS, ensuring its functionality and reliability before its implementation in real power systems. The success of dynamic testing using the RTDS platform opens up opportunities for ADS development in other PLN Power System regions, reducing dependence on major manufacturers for conducting such tests.","","979-8-3503-1867-8","10.1109/ICHVEPS58902.2023.10257315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10257315","Testing;Adaptive Defense Scheme (ADS);Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS);real-time simulator;Hardware-in-the-loop;load shedding","Software testing;Adaptation models;Heuristic algorithms;Power system dynamics;Power system stability;Stability analysis;Software","","","","9","IEEE","26 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine learning approaches, in turn, learn vehicle behavior through the observation of other drivers and the environment, the latter being a key factor that influences vehicle behavior. However, the amount of influence of the environment on vehicle behavior cannot be grasped by uniformly analyzing the entire driving route. Thus, this paper proposes a range-based causal analysis to inspect the effects that specific locations have on vehicle behavior. In other words, to use range or distance from a target to concentrate the analysis of vehicle behavior on a particular location. To interpret vehicle behavior, we employed a semantic primitive motion clustering that combines Hierarchical clustering and HDP-HSMM. Common causes for vehicle behavior change were then extracted by tracking the traffic participants, and the environment was segmented by region and ranges of each region, comparing three different types of regions: crosswalks, traffic lights, and entrances. The results show valuable insight into vehicle behavior by highlighting key primitive motions that take place only in a particular region depending on the range of proximity. Moreover, a comparison of the three studied regions shows that they present singular patterns of behavior if analyzed by range. For instance, vehicles heading to an entrance tend to drastically reduce velocity when being close to an entrance and pedestrians. The same does not happen in proximity to other vehicles, in which case the vehicle comes to a complete stop. Moreover, it was observed that the vehicle behavior changes according to each of the three traffic regions considered in the study. This insight into the key primitives obtained using the proposed approach can be key to understanding different scenarios of interaction between the environment and autonomous vehicles.","","978-1-6654-3684-7","10.1109/ICAR53236.2021.9659455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9659455","","Target tracking;Automation;Motion segmentation;Semantics;Machine learning;Trajectory;Autonomous vehicles","","","","17","IEEE","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, LNA's reliable operation is mainly guaranteed through the testing of multiple performance parameters. The testing cost is high and the testing time is long. Moreover, the coupling relationship between each component and each test parameter is not considered, so it is difficult to isolate the faults. The multi-signal model uses a directed graph to describe the propagation dependence of faults, which is a very effective method in electronic system-level fault diagnosis. In this paper, a multi-signal model is proposed to describe the propagation dependence between the LNA fault modes and each test parameter, then a multi-core parallel diagnosis algorithm based on the multi-signal model and OpenMP is proposed for the rapid diagnosis of RF circuits. ADS is used to simulate the LNA circuit based on ATF54143.

The performance was tested and estimated in stabilized fog conditions at Cerema fog chamber facilities. This provides a good basis for repeating the same validation procedure multiple times and ensuring the right development decisions. However, performance of the LiDARs suffers when the weather conditions become adverse and visibility range decreases. A 50% reduction in target detection performance was observed over the exhaustive tests. Therefore, changing to higher wavelengths (1550 nm) was considered using redesigned “pre-prototype LiDAR”. The preliminary results indicate that there is no reason to not use 1550 nm wavelength, which due to eye safety regulations gives an opportunity to use 20 times more power compared to the traditional 905 nm.

Fuzz testing uses automated directed randomness to explore a variety of execution paths in software, trying to expose defects such as buffer overflows. Since cyber-physical systems (CPS) are often safety-critical, testing models of CPS can also expose faults. However, while existing coverage-guided fuzz testing methods are effective for software, results can be disappointing when applied to CPS, where systems have continuous states and inputs are applied at different points in time. In this work, we propose three changes to customize coverage-guided fuzz testing methods to better leverage characteristics of CPS. First, we introduce a notion of coverage to be used to evaluate a fuzz testing algorithm's effectiveness for a particular CPS, analogous to often-used code coverage metrics of a software system. Second, this modified coverage metric is used in a customized power schedule, which selects which previous input sequences hold the most promise to find failures in new system states. Third, we modify the input mutation strategy used to reason with the causal nature of a CPS. Our proposed system, which we call CPS-Fuzz, is compared with three other fuzz testing frameworks on a autonomous car racing software and provides a superior coverage score by generating more crashes at different positions around the track.","","978-1-6654-0967-4","10.1109/ICCPS54341.2022.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9797531","cyber-physical systems;fuzz testing;test generation;coverage met-ric;autonomous vehicle","Measurement;Space vehicles;Schedules;Software algorithms;Vehicle crash testing;Fuzzing;Cyber-physical systems","","7","","50","IEEE","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, their assumptions about the training program are not always true as training programs can contain inconsistencies and bugs. In this paper, we examine training issues in ML programs and propose a catalog of verification routines that can be used to detect the identified issues, automatically. We implemented the routines in a Tensorflow-based library named TFCheck. Using TFCheck, practitioners can detect the aforementioned issues automatically. To assess the effectiveness of TFCheck, we conducted a case study with real-world, mutants, and synthetic training programs. Results show that TFCheck can successfully detect training issues in ML code implementations.","","978-1-7281-3927-2","10.1109/QRS.2019.00059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854684","Deep Learning;TensorFlow program;Testing;Training issues","Training;Testing;Libraries;Data models;Computer bugs;Neurons;Biological neural networks","","6","","14","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, In this paper, a GPS-aided auto navigation system is proposed with position control and heading control of AV. Further, to test the proposed algorithm an AV is designed and developed with low-cost sensors and actuators. The real-time testing of the proposed adaptive control auto navigation mechanism has been performed with three test cases such as straight line, L-shaped and Semi-circular. The results shown in this paper are the deviation between the travelled path and the defined path of the vehicle in different trajectories by assuming no obstacles in the path. The deviation of the path travelled by AV with respect to the defined path using the proposed algorithm is less than 0.5m. Finally, the telemetry of AV has been monitored by the developed Graphical User Interface (GUI). This work is very useful in auto navigation of vehicles where humans can not be sustained.","","978-1-6654-5572-5","10.1109/ESDC56251.2023.10149881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10149881","Autonomous Vehicle;Auto Navigation;GPS;Heading Control;Position Control","Navigation;Sensor systems;Sensors;Trajectory;Safety;Telemetry;Autonomous vehicles","","1","","11","IEEE","29 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To save the effort of manually checking the validity and improve test efficiency, it is important to assess the effectiveness and reliability of automated validators. In this study, we comprehensively assess four automated Input Validators (IV s), Our findings show that the accuracy of IVs ranges from 49% to 77%.

However, such systems heavily rely on the availability of high-quality data, which is often prepared/generated by the Extract Transform Load (ETL) data pipelines; thus, they are critical components of an end-to-end ML system. A low-performing model (trained on buggy data) running in a production environment can cause both financial and reputational losses for the organization. Therefore, it is of paramount significance to perform the quality assurance of underlying data pipelines from multiple perspectives. However, the computational complexity, continuous change in data, and the integration of multiple components make it challenging to test them effectively, ultimately causing such solutions to suffer from the Oracle problem. In this research paper, we propose MetaCDP, a Metamorphic Testing approach that can be used by both researchers and practitioners for quality assurance of modern Containerized Data Pipelines. We propose 10 Metamorphic Relations (MRs) that target the robustness and correctness of the data pipeline under test, which plays a crucial role in providing high-quality data for developing a clustering-based anomaly detection model. To show the applicability of the proposed approach, we tested a data pipeline (from the E-commerce domain) and uncovered several erroneous behaviors. We also present the nature of issues identified by the proposed MRs, which can better help/guide software engineers and researchers to use best coding practices for maintaining and improving the quality of their data pipelines.","","979-8-3503-7006-5","10.1109/Cloud-Summit61220.2024.00029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10630976","Testing ETL pipelines;Metamorphic Testing;Quality Assurance of Docker Containers;Oracle problem in ETL pipelines;MiniKube;Testing Data Engineering Applications;Testing Data Pipelines","Quality assurance;Pipelines;Machine learning;Transforms;Data models;Software;Software reliability","","","","23","IEEE","14 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method is computationally tractable, and its generated experimental parameters are optimized using past test results. The method includes five essential modules. The Exploration and Exploitation module uses the Multi-arm bandit method to obtain the greatest sum of the  $TTC^{\mathbf {-1}}$  (Time To Collision). The Parameter Moving Probability Determination module uses an analytic hierarchy process to ensure that influential parameters are more likely to move. The Step Size Determination module is built with Levy-step to find a greater number of hazardous scenarios. The Memory Function module is used to avoid repeat experiments that can reduce computing efficiency. The Result Analysis module creates a hazard parameter space for subsequent tests. We tested an ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) algorithm with a specified logical scenario in the virtual environment built by PreScan.

However, the development of Fog Computing systems is a big challenge due to its complex, heterogeneous and distributed nature. Currently, there are a few SDKs released by some public Cloud service providers to support the development of Fog services in a top-down fashion as the key motive is to leverage their business Cloud services. However, Fog Computing systems are usually designed in a bottom-up fashion as the major functionalities are centred around the Edge Nodes and the End Devices. Meanwhile, significant efforts are required to verify the conformance of software behaviours as the collaboration between the End Devices, Edge Nodes and Cloud Servers is vital to the success of a Fog Computing System. Therefore, a holistically designed software development platform is urgently required. In this paper, we propose TDD4Fog, a test-driven software development platform for Fog Computing systems. Following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology and a bottom-up design fashion, TDD4Fog supports the microservice architecture and provides the Test-Driven utilities such as metamorphic testing, mutation testing and random testing for the whole software development lifecycle of Fog Computing systems.

In contrast, we propose a different strategy: an inplace method. Instead of examining relations among multiple input streams, our method works on a finer granularity by investigating relations among the data frames within a single input stream - such as the relations among the image frames within a video stream - treating a frame, rather than a stream, as a test case. Because our method does not generate any follow-up input stream, or change any frame values, it is also suitable for runtime error detection. We have applied this in-place method to testing video streams in Baidu Apollo, a real-life autonomous driving system.

In this paper, we propose believed equivalence, where the establishment of an equivalence class is initially based on expert belief and is subject to a set of available test cases having a consistent valuation. Upon a newly encountered test case that breaks the consistency, one may need to refine the established categorization in order to split the originally believed equivalence into two.

This data includes sensor readings, information about the surrounding environment, and potentially user data. Consequently, addressing concerns related to data processing, sharing among various stakeholders, privacy, integrity, and security is of utmost importance. This paper tackles the data sharing challenge by proposing and evaluating a platform built on Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain technology. This platform aims to facilitate secure and efficient data sharing between all parties involved with AVs. Our initial testing reveals that the number of simulated users (virtual user count) and the amount of data processed (data load) can negatively impact the system's performance.

Using deep visual learning architectures is not trivial in this context, because of the challenges in creating suitable large scale annotated datasets. This issue has been traditionally circumvented through the use of synthetic datasets, that have become a popular resource in this field. They have been released with the need to develop semantic segmentation algorithms able to close the visual domain shift between the training and test data. Although exacerbated by the use of artificial data, the problem is extremely relevant in this field even when training on real data. Indeed, weather conditions, viewpoint changes and variations in the city appearances can vary considerably from car to car, and even at test time for a single, specific vehicle. How to deal with domain adaptation in semantic segmentation, and how to leverage effectively several different data distributions (source domains) are important research questions in this field. To support work in this direction, this letter contributes a new large scale, synthetic dataset for semantic segmentation with more than 100 different source visual domains.

AORTA creates scale simulations of the real world by generating maps using publicly available road data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). This allows simulations to be set up through AORTA for a desired region anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes. AORTA allows for traffic optimization by creating intelligent behaviors for individual driver agents and intersection policies to be followed by these agents.

Companies need to collect and annotate lots of data to properly train deep learning perception models. Simulation systems have come up as an alternative to the expensive task of data collection and annotation. However, whether simulated data can be used as a proxy for real-world data is an ongoing debate. In this work, we attempt to address the question of whether models trained on simulated data can generalize well to the real-world. We collect datasets based on two different simulators with varying levels of graphics fidelity and use the KITTI dataset as an example of real- world data. We train three separate deep learning based object detection models on each of these datasets, and compare their performance on test sets collected from the same sources. We also add the recently released Waymo Open Dataset as a challenging test set. Performance is evaluated based on the mean average precision (mAP) metric for object detection. We find that training on simulation in general does not translate to generalizability on real-world data and that diversity in the training set is much more important than visual graphics' fidelity.","","978-1-7281-6984-2","10.1109/AITEST49225.2020.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9176787","Autonomous Driving;Self-driving cars;Perception;YOLOv3;Deep learning","Data models;Object detection;Cameras;Training;Automobiles;Sensors;Task analysis","","13","","28","IEEE","25 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a quantification method of scenario complexity is proposed. Firstly, scenario complexity is defined as the measurement of the uncertainties of all dynamic entities. As the moving vehicles are viewed as random variables, information entropy is introduced to represent the uncertainties of dynamic entities. Secondly, the drivable area has been brought up to compute the entropy of each vehicle in the scenario by using a search-based trajectory cluster generation algorithm. Then, the scenario complexity is evaluated by combining the entropies of all dynamic entities.

Unfortunately, reality has caught up with the original optimism and enthusiasm that envisaged fully automated vehicles on the roads by 2020. The development of vehicles that can operate fully autonomously, without human intervention, worldwide in all environmental conditions remains an open problem and still requires some development effort. The preparation of an approach for certification and validation of autonomous car systems completely independent from the vehicles control system themselves remains a significant problem. To validate the safety of the systems, this work introduces the Shadow System (SS), an original and novel system that allows the detection and handling of problems in automated vehicles under real conditions. The method uses the human driver as a reference to verify the safe operation of a vehicle. A way to measure behavioral differences for steering movements is presented using a specially developed component called the Shadow Steering Wheel (SSW). This enables the steering movements of the human driver and automated vehicle to be measured independently. The proposed system is based on non-intrusive techniques. With the presented method, safety-critical and problematic traffic scenarios can be objectively identified in real time under real conditions during the validation phase and safely corrected by the human driver.","","978-1-6654-8817-4","10.1109/ICE/ITMC-IAMOT55089.2022.10033188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10033188","autonomous vehicles;safety-critical scenarios;real-world testing;human behavior;difference detection","Roads;Instruments;Wheels;Prototypes;Production;Real-time systems;Behavioral sciences","","1","","25","IEEE","10 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, no production-ready autonomous vehicle on the market can operate without a human driver in a wide range of regions and environmental conditions. Due to the high complexity of the systems and the varied traffic scenarios, development, and validation are challenging and time-consuming. With the aid of simulation technology, good validation in a scalable form can be performed during development. However, the current standards for traffic safety validation require a final validation under real conditions. In this work, a framework called Shadow System (SS) is presented, which independently captures the control commands of the human driver and the vehicle. This unique approach enables the detection of problems in automated systems by identifying behavioral differences. Up to a defined safety range allows the human driver and the vehicle to execute control commands without affecting each other. This makes it possible, for example, to determine how a human driver steers the vehicle compared to the automated system in a given traffic situation. The developed method enables safe use under real conditions, as control can be taken over directly by the human driver at any time.

To test more logic for Deep Neuron Network (DNN), TSDTest generates highly diverse test cases with as high neuron coverage as possible during its two stages. Compared with DLFuzz, TSDTest achieved an average 1.75% improvement in neuron coverage and 80.3% more adversarial test inputs on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST.

However, due to their black-box nature in system, the underlying mechanisms of DNNs behind the inference results remain opaque to users. In order to address this challenge, researchers have focused on developing explainable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Explainable AI aims to provide a clear and human-understandable explanation of the model’s decision, thereby building more reliable systems. However, the explanation task differs from well-known inference and training processes as it involves interactions with the user. Consequently, existing inference and training accelerators face inefficiencies when processing explainable AI on edge devices. This article introduces explainable processing unit (EPU), the first hardware accelerator designed for explainable AI workloads. The EPU utilizes a novel data compression format for the output heat maps and intermediate gradients to enhance the overall system performance by reducing both memory footprint and external memory access. Its sparsity-free computing core efficiently handles the input sparsity with negligible control overhead, resulting in a throughput boost of up to 9.48× It also proposes a dynamic workload scheduling with a customized ON-chip network for distinct inference and explanation tasks to maximize internal data reuse hence reducing external memory access by 63.7%. Furthermore, the EPU incorporates point-wise gradient pruning (PGP) that can significantly reduce the size of heat maps by a factor of 7.01× combined with the proposed compression format. Finally, the EPU chip fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS process achieves a remarkable heat map generation rate of 367 frames/s for ResNet-34 while maintaining the state-of-the-art area and energy efficiency of 112.3 GOPS/mm2 and 26.55 TOPS/W, respectively.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2023.3346913","ITRC Support Program(grant numbers:IITP-2020-0-01847); MSIT, South Korea; Samsung Electronics; Korea Institute of Marine Science and Technology Promotion (KIMST) through the Korea Coast Guard (Integrated Satellite-Based Applications Development for Korea Coast Guard)(grant numbers:RS-2023-00238652); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10412195","Convolutional neural network (CNN);deep neural network (DNN);explainable artificial intelligence (XAI);multiple DNN acceleration;neural processing unit (NPU)","Artificial intelligence;Heat maps;Convolutional neural networks;Labeling;Artificial neural networks;Explainable AI","","","","29","IEEE","23 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

CNN based methods like Faster R-CNN for object detection provide human level accuracy and real time performance and are proven successful in Traffic Sign Recognition systems [1]. Single stage detection systems such as YOLO [2] and SSD [3], despite offering state-of-the-art realtime detection speed, are not preferred for traffic sign detection problem due to its reduced accuracy and small object detection issues. RetinaNet has shown promising results with respect to accuracy and speed required for object detection problems. It uses Focal Loss [4] and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) [5] for tackling the low accuracy and small object detection problems. In this paper, an approach for traffic sign recognition system for self-driving cars based on RetinaNet is presented with comparative analysis of its performance with Faster R-CNN based sign detector [1] and YOLOv3 [9] based detector. RetinaNet forms the traffic sign detection network and a CNN-based classifier forms the traffic sign class recognizer.

Manually specified scenarios can focus on a given feature, but their design might be difficult and time-consuming, especially to achieve satisfactory coverage. In this work, we propose an automatic approach to generate a large number of relevant critical scenarios for autonomous driving simulators. The approach is based on the generation of behavioral conformance tests from a formal model (specifying the ground truth configuration with the range of vehicle behaviors) and a test purpose (specifying the critical feature to focus on). The obtained abstract test cases cover, by construction, all possible executions exercising a given feature, and can be automatically translated into the inputs of autonomous driving simulators. We illustrate our approach by generating thousands of behavior trees for the CARLA simulator for several realistic configurations.","1558-1101","978-3-9819263-6-1","10.23919/DATE54114.2022.9774581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9774581","Behavior trees;CARLA simulator;Formal meth-ods;Input-output conformance;Scenario generation;Test purpose","Roads;Conformance testing;Behavioral sciences;Autonomous vehicles","","6","","22","","19 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Testing is predominantly used to verify and validate the functionality of the automotive embedded software-intensive systems. Formal verification (FV) based on model-checking promises rigor compared to traditional testing, because it is exhaustive in nature. Mutation testing is the method of inducing defects into the design to assess the quality of a test-suite. In this paper, we propose and present a new mutation testing based process to assess FV tools. Majority of this work was accomplished during the UK's Advanced Manufacturing Supply Chain Initiative (AMSCII) funded Proving Integrity of Complex Automotive Systems of Systems (PICASSOS) project. To demonstrate our approach, we have utilized an advanced design process involving specific FV tools (General Technology Validation (GTV) and Simulink Design Verifier (SLDV)), to detect defects in (Simulink/Stateflow based) software specifications. The case-study examples involve applications across automotive and aerospace industry domains. The defects in specifications are induced mutations drawn from a set of known defects gathered from literature. Results from experiments indicate that mutation testing is an effective testing technique not only to improve test-suites in any testing effort, e.g., for the emerging Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) within the automotive industry, but also to assess whether FV tools help testers identify defects effectively with confidence. In addition, the mutation testing technique has the potential to help identify any subtle differences between various FV tools.","","978-1-5386-3690-9","10.1109/DSA.2017.10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8269594","Mutation testing;Formal verification;Model-driven development;System verification;Automotive applications;Modeling defects;Mutations;Test-suite.","Modeling;Testing;Mathematical model;Tools;Automotive engineering;Software packages","","6","","35","IEEE","25 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One such application is autonomous vehicles (AVs), which comes under the category of AI in ITS. Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANET) makes communication possible between AVs in the system. The performance of each vehicle depends upon the information exchanged between AVs. False or malicious information can perturb the whole system leading to severe consequences. Hence, the detection of malicious vehicles is of utmost importance. We use machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the flaw in the data transmitted. Recent papers that used the stacking ML approach gave an accuracy of 98.44%. Decision tree-based random forest is used to solve the problem in this paper. We achieved accuracy and F1 score of 98.43% and 98.5% respectively on the VeRiMi dataset in this paper. Explainable AI (XAI) is the method and technique to make the complex black-box ML and deep learning (DL) models more interpretable and understandable. We use a particular model interface of the evaluation metrics to explain and measure the model’s performance.

As mentioned in this regulation, each company is obligated to report any incident within ten days after occurrence. Based on the collision reports, this paper provides a comprehensive overview and an in-depth analysis regarding all types of accidents which were documented as a part of testing regulations and in which at least one AV was involved. All data gathered from the collision reports are analyzed to identify the root cause of the accidents and to determine whether the AV was the cause of the accident, or on the contrary, it could have potentially avoided the accident.

However, recently reported crashes indicate that this goal is far from being achieved. Hence, cost-effective testing of autonomous driving systems (ADSs) has become a prominent research topic. The classical model-based testing (MBT), i.e., generating test cases from test models followed by executing the test cases, is ineffective for testing ADSs, mainly because of the constant exposure to ever-changing operating environments, and uncertain internal behaviors due to employed AI techniques. Thus, MBT must be adaptive to guide test case generation based on test execution results in a step-wise manner. To this end, we propose a natural language and model-based approach, named LiveTCM, to automatically execute and generate test case specifications (TCSs) by interacting with an ADS under test and its environment. LiveTCM is evaluated with an open-source ADS and two test generation strategies: Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based and Random. Results show that LiveTCM with DQN can generate TCSs with 56 steps on average in 60 seconds, leading to 6.4 test oracle violations and covering 14 APIs per TCS on average.","","978-1-6654-3495-9","10.1109/MODELS50736.2021.00019","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872182); Research Council of Norway(grant numbers:274385); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9592382","Natural Language and Model-based Testing;Adaptive Test Generation;Autonomous Driving","Adaptation models;Natural languages;Model driven engineering;Test pattern generators;Automobiles;Artificial intelligence;Autonomous vehicles","","2","","28","IEEE","11 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To date, existing APR approaches focus on repairing software bugs, such as memory safety bugs. However, our analysis of popular robotic vehicle (RV) control software shows that most of their bugs are not memory bugs but rather logic bugs. These bugs, while not causing software crashes, can cause an RV to reach an undesired physical state (e.g., hitting the ground). To fix these logic bugs, we introduce PGPatch, a policy-guided program repair framework for RV control programs, which identifies the correct patch for a given logic bug and applies it without human intervention. PGPatch takes, as input, existing or new logic formulas used to discover logic bugs. It then leverages the formulas using a dedicated dynamic analysis to classify the previously known logic bugs into a patch type. It next uses a customized algorithm, based on the identified patch type and violated formula, to produce a source code patch as output. Lastly, it creates repeatable tests to verify the patch’s completeness, ensuring that the patch is correct and does not degrade the RV’s performance. We evaluate PGPatch on selected bug cases from three popular RV control software and find that it correctly fixes 258 out of 297 logic bugs (86.9%). We additionally recruit 18 experienced RV developers and users and conduct a user study that demonstrates how using PGPatch makes fixing bugs in RV software significantly quicker and less error-prone.","2375-1207","978-1-6654-1316-9","10.1109/SP46214.2022.9833567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9833567","automated-program-repair;Robotic-Vehicle;Logic-bug;Patching","Privacy;Codes;Heuristic algorithms;Computer bugs;Maintenance engineering;Software;Safety","","5","","83","IEEE","27 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Digital virtual simulation scene generation methods offer significant technological advantages in terms of scene diversity, risk assessment, interpretability, and generation efficiency. They have become a key factor in enhancing the safety and reliability of testing and validation for autonomous driving technology. Consequently, they have become a prominent research focus in the field of automotive intelligence. This article delves into the crucial issue of scene generation in autonomous driving simulation. With the continuous advancement of autonomous driving technology, simulation has become a vital tool for testing, validating, and optimizing autonomous driving systems. The article notably introduces a knowledge-driven approach to personalized scene generation. It uses a hierarchical model to describe the relationships between different levels of scenes and analyzes the structure of OpenSCENARIO format files along with parameterization methods. This results in an automated script capable of generating specific scene files in bulk, tailored to testing requirements, thereby significantly enhancing the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving system development. However, the article also acknowledges that current research is in its early stages and can only generate simple scenes, potentially falling short of meeting the testing requirements for higher-level autonomous driving safety assessments. Future work will concentrate on developing knowledge-driven methods for generating critical scenes, aiming to improve the equivalence and rationality of specific scenes to address more advanced testing needs.

While AVs may help reduce crashes caused by human error, they still may experience failures of technologies and sensing, as well as decision-making errors in a mixed traffic environment. A disengagement refers to an AV transitioning control from autonomous systems to the trained test driver. The safety critical nature of disengagements makes it imperative to analyze disengagements and crashes together. This study analyzes both crashes and disengagements from real-world AV driving in California to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between disengagements and crashes in a mixed traffic environment. A nested logit model was calibrated using three different outcomes: (1) disengagement with a crash, (2) disengagement with no crash, and (3) no disengagement with a crash. Furthermore, endogenous switching regime models were also calibrated to draw distinctions between the relation of disengagements and crashes while accounting for endogeneity effects. The results show that factors related to AV systems (such as software failures) and other roadway participants increase the propensity of a disengagement without a crash. Furthermore, AVs were observed to disengage less often as the technology matured over time. Marginal effects revealed an 8% decrease. The results thus suggest that disengagements are a part of AVs’ safe performance and disengagement alerts may need to be triggered in order to avoid certain failures with current technology.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3003527","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142420","Autonomous vehicles;disengagements;safety critical events;nested logit model;endogenous switching regime;software and sensor failure","Vehicle crash testing;Computer crashes;Sensors;Vehicle safety;Road traffic;Testing;Autonomous vehicles","","36","","30","USGov","16 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Objectives of this review are to identify research gaps that need to be filled and to propose a roadmap for future research. Since FAVs are operated by software and hardware, with no human driver required, interactions between other road users and FAVs must be understood, and potential risks must be addressed. This is especially true for pedestrians, who often exhibit unpredictable behavior and are one of the most vulnerable road-user groups. A comprehensive review was conducted of 1) different aspects of pedestrian interaction with forthcoming fully automated vehicles, and 2) the existing research approaches (surveys and simulator studies) for investigating risky pedestrian behavior as well as public acceptance of fully automated vehicles. The review identified three major gaps in pedestrian research: 1) lack of a pedestrian behavior questionnaire for FAV research, 2) lack of a validated pedestrian simulator for FAV research, and 3) lack of research investigating pedestrian design suggestions for FAVs. A future research roadmap to facilitate investigating pedestrian receptivity toward FAVs was designed. Achieving pedestrian acceptance of FAVs will require investigation of pedestrian risks and needs by transportation researchers and communication of the results to vehicle manufacturers and regulatory agencies. This review will be useful to transportation researchers and automated vehicle manufacturers to help guide planning for future design and production of FAVs in order to ensure their successful implementation.","2168-2305","","10.1109/THMS.2018.2799523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8294042","Autonomous vehicles;human-automation interaction;simulation;virtual reality (VR)","Roads;Automation;Automobiles;Vehicle crash testing;Legged locomotion","","31","","96","IEEE","16 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Virtual testing requires models of the controlled vehicle, but also of the surrounding traffic, which for a long time will consist mainly of human-driven vehicles. Many driver and traffic models exist, but they are usually tailored for a specific situation or requirement. As the reaction of human drivers is affected by many different factors, like the traffic conditions, the time or the country, there is a need for a flexible structure which can be easily tuned to different situations. If we split the driver reaction in a decision and an actuation step, we argue that the actuation step can be represented by few stochastic actuation models which do not depend strongly on external factors.

Self-driving cars rely on advanced systems known as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) that help in perceiving the driving environment despite being on the road. Automobile lane detection is repeatedly considered effective in building up the recognition of the nearest lanes. Is it capable of discerning lane markings and objects on the side of the road or, topologically, it does not have to make a rolling contact? To answer this query, hence we apply road segmentation techniques that involve delineation of objects of interest along the road. In this paper, we compared two models named VGG-19 and UNET by observing their accuracy in detecting road lanes, objects, and cars. We find that the VGG-19 model achieves superior accuracy, about 40% accuracy with 93% precision in detecting complex road structures compared to the UNET model in our 95 images.

The higher level of Automated Driving Assistance System (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving System (ADS) are considered the promising solutions. However, subsystems inside are developed individually without considering the interaction among the intelligent functionalities and motions. It may cause issues on system integration. For example, Decision Subsystem in ADS normally defines the reference trajectory and the speed profile without considering the vehicle dynamics and its operating limit. The vehicle might not be able to achieve the requirement. The risks of the vehicle leaving the defined track or doing unexpected behaviors may occur. The Control Subsystem thus needs to acquire the operating limit information of vehicular motion to ensure vehicle safety.To deal with the aforementioned issue, a path follower which obtains the functionality of self-diagnosis and vehicle speed adjustment is designed as an approach in this paper. With the acquired road adhesion(μ), both the longitudinal and lateral acceleration margin, which is regarded as the acceleration limit of a vehicle, can be calculated as the boundary of vehicle dynamic operation. The margin is thus crucial for the Control Subsystem to determine the proper speed for path following.In this paper, the Control subsystem with the proposed function is examined through a Model-in-the-Loop (MiL) test with Carsim-PreScan co-simulation. According to the results, the system is verified to be able to control the vehicle on track by adjusting its target speed.

Besides, state-of-theart ANNs require significant memory resources to store their parameters (e.g., weights, activation values), which goes outside the possibility of many resource-constrained embedded systems.

Method: To address these challenges, we provide an open and reusable benchmarking framework for systematic evaluation and comparative analysis of deep reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous driving in a single- and multi-agent environment. Using the framework, we perform a comparative study of four discrete and two continuous action space deep reinforcement learning algorithms. We also propose a comprehensive multi-objective reward function designed for the evaluation of deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous driving agents. We run the experiments in a vision-only high-fidelity urban driving simulated environments. Results: The results indicate that only some of the deep reinforcement learning algorithms perform consistently better across single and multi-agent scenarios when trained in various multi-agent-only environment settings. For example, A3C- and TD3-based autonomous cars perform comparatively better in terms of more robust actions and minimal driving errors in both single and multi-agent scenarios. Conclusions: We conclude that different deep reinforcement learning algorithms exhibit different driving and testing performance in different scenarios, which underlines the need for their systematic comparative analysis. The benchmarking framework proposed in this paper facilitates such a comparison.","2693-9177","978-1-6654-7704-8","10.1109/QRS57517.2022.00084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062456","deep reinforcement learning;multi-agent systems;autonomous cars;autonomous driving;testing autonomous driving","Deep learning;Training;Systematics;Reinforcement learning;Software quality;Benchmark testing;Robustness","","5","","50","IEEE","20 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the research uses a specific penetration rate of CAVs. The contribution of this study is to fill that gap by testing a new real-time traffic management method, named SWSCAV (utilization of shockwave-speed information and connected autonomous vehicles for traffic management in case of congestion or incident) in case of a traffic incident in an uninterrupted traffic flow environment with a very limited number of CAVs to improve conditions of the traffic flow conditions. By changing the lane and duration of the simulated incident and adjusting the arrival frequency of the CAVs and the position where the CAVs reduce their speeds, 189 different scenarios are tested. Mean flow, density, and speed values are selected as measures of effectiveness. These metrics are inspected both network-wide and locally using a Simulation of the Urban Mobility (SUMO) environment. A maximum of 12 CAVs are used. The results show that introducing SWSCAV with a limited number of CAVs means speed and flow values can increase up to 20.35% and 2.45%, respectively. Additionally, a decrease in mean density up to 32.54% can also be observed with this management approach.

The expectation is that if a DNN is well tested (and retrained) according to such coverage criteria, it is more likely to be robust. In this work, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the relationship between coverage, robustness and attack/defense metrics for DNN.

For the achievement of this goal, this work presents two contributions. Firstly, we provide an optimal parameterization of existing driver behavior models for urban traffic based on real-world vehicle trajectory data gathered in Ingolstadt, Germany. Secondly, the result of the calibration is assessed for potential improvements and central design aspects of future models for environment simulation. Using a simulation of the city in SUMO, the best calibration result is achieved with the Krauss model with slightly modified parameters compared to the default parameters. Deviations between the calibrated simulation and the real-world data are evaluated for individual roads.

Deep learning for traffic light detection and recognition is a popular solution to this problem. However, the problem arises when there are multiple traffic lights in the scene with different states Where choosing the correct traffic light to follow becomes a real challenge, which can be solved by using prior maps. In this paper, a two-fold solution is proposed. First, a mobile application is created that constructs prior maps for traffic lights autonomously. Second, the constructed prior maps and deep learning approaches are used in conjunction with computer vision approaches to assist the driver in determining the status of the relevant traffic lights. In this paper, YOLO- v4 was utilised. The proposed framework was trained on the LISA traffic light dataset, while the prior maps and testing were conducted on the streets of Cairo. It was shown that the proposed approach was able to correctly and promptly identify the status and relevancy of the traffic lights with 92.29% mean Average Precision (mAP).","","978-1-6654-6495-6","10.1109/SITIS57111.2022.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10090125","","Deep learning;Video on demand;Laser radar;Urban areas;Transfer learning;Mobile applications;Automobiles","","","","11","IEEE","10 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Scenario-based testing stands out as a crucial method for evaluating AVs, with a key focus on constructing appropriate testing scenarios. Given the vulnerability of Powered Two-Wheelers (PTWs) riders, it is essential to investigate typical and representative car-to-PTWs crash scenarios and validate AV system safety performance in such situations. This study introduces a new method for generating high-risk scenarios by extracting typical testing scenarios from real-world crashes, thereby enhancing the realism of testing conditions. To evaluate the safety performance of AV systems, a crash-based testing approach is proposed. First, 222 car-to-PTWs crashes were extracted from the China In-depth Mobility Safety Study-Traffic Accident (CIMSS-TA) database and the pre-crash trajectories of crash-involved parties were accurately obtained by reconstructing the crashes case-by-case. Second, utilizing the k-medoids algorithm based on the Hausdorff distance to cluster these trajectories, six typical pre-crash trajectory clusters were extracted. Third, six sets of high-risk scenarios were generated using parameter discretization and combination testing based on the cluster centers. Finally, we conducted safety testing on the black-box automated driving system, Baidu Apollo, using the SVL Simulator virtual simulation platform. We evaluated its performance by subjecting it to the six sets of high-risk scenarios generated in this study. The experimental results demonstrate that Apollo can operate safely in most high-risk scenarios, indicating that automated driving systems can handle crashes that some human drivers cannot avoid, thereby improve traffic safety.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2024.3392673","National Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFB2504703); Hunan Provincial Leading Talents in Science and Technology Innovation(grant numbers:2021RC4009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10528191","Traffic safety;autonomous vehicles;testing scenarios;clustering analysis","Accidents;Testing;Safety;Trajectory;Roads;Databases;Automobiles","","3","","49","IEEE","9 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The use of collective perception as a communication service for future fully autonomous driving requires a thorough evaluation and validation. Most of the previous work on collective perception has considered large scale-simulations with a focus on communications. However, the perception pipeline used for collective perception is equally important and must not be neglected or over-simplified. Also, to study collective perception in detail, large-scale field testing is practically infeasible. In this paper we extend an existing simulation framework with a realistic model for V2X communications and sensor-data based processing delays. The result is a simulation framework that incorporates the entire collective perception pipeline, which enables to comprehensively study sensor-based perception. We demonstrate the capabilities of this enhanced framework by analyzing the delay of each component involved in the perception pipeline. This allows a detailed insight in end-to-end delays and the age of information within the environmental model of autonomous vehicles.","","978-1-7281-9142-3","10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564783","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9564783","","Conferences;Pipelines;Information age;Delays;Vehicle-to-everything;Autonomous vehicles;Intelligent transportation systems","","15","","27","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Selected test scenarios from vehicle dynamics, NCAP, highway and urban driving have been configured and executed in manual, assisted and automated driving mode. It can be shown that the unique integration of Powertrain-, Steering- and Brake-in-the-Loop together with Sensor-in-the-Loop allows highly realistic tests in the complete vehicle operation range up and beyond the dynamic limits.

Due to the safety-critical application of these systems, a reliable implementation requires an extensive testing process of hardware and software units as well as the entire integrated system. The increasing complexity of these systems, which incrementally have more control over the vehicle, makes purely real-world safeguarding impracticable. As a solution, complementary virtual tests are used to support the validation process in a safe and accelerated way. However, a method for distributing test cases across real and virtual domains according to the relevance of the test method has yet to be defined. In this paper, we investigate different levels of reality in testing ADAS/automated driving functions and derive advantages, disadvantages, and system limitations for each. An emergency braking system serves as a use case, which is evaluated using Hardware-in-the-Loop, Sensor-in-the-Loop, Vehicle-in-the-Loop test methods, as well as vehicle tests on a proving ground. The obtained results show that simulation-based testing is a useful complement to real-world testing. However, various phenomena such as actuator delays or camera lenses have a large impact on the obtained results and need to be taken into account (in models) to ensure the realism of the simulation-based approaches. In addition, the inclusion of real components increases the deviations between test repetitions, being necessary to conduct real tests to evaluate the final performance of the integrated system.","","978-1-6654-8821-1","10.1109/IV51971.2022.9827394","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9827394","","Wireless LAN;Actuators;Virtual environments;Systems architecture;Cameras;Software;Delays","","7","","31","IEEE","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes using residue codes for detecting soft errors in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and in particular, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. We attach Concurrent Error Detection (CED) hardware units to an entire LSTM structure or its substructures. Depending on the granularity of the components to which they are applied, CEDs are referred to as coarse-grain or fine-grain CEDs. The simulation results show that in fault detection rate and misprediction coverage rate, fine-grain CEDs have a better performance than coarse-grain. Specifically, fine-grain residue-based CEDs provide up to 97% fault detection for extremely large (10-2) bit error rates. Moreover, they reduce the misprediction rate by 84% compared to unprotected LSTM.","2473-2117","979-8-3503-3277-3","10.1109/DDECS57882.2023.10139388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10139388","Reliability;Soft error resiliency;Concurrent error detection;Recurrent Neural Network Accelerators","Recurrent neural networks;Fault detection;Simulation;Electron accelerators;Reliability engineering;Hardware;Integrated circuit reliability","","1","","19","IEEE","2 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these companies are reluctant to share their data, to both protect their intellectual property and the privacy of their users. Federated Learning is an approach that allows for collaborative, privacy-preserving training of DNNs. Inspired by this technique, this work proposes Federated Repair in order to collaboratively repair a DNN model without the need for sharing any raw data. We implemented Federated Repair based on a state-of-the-art DNN repair technique, and applied it to three DNN models, with federation size from 2 to 10. Results show that Federated Repair can achieve the same repair efficiency as non-federated DNN repair using the pooled data, despite the presence of rounding errors when aggregating clients’ results.","","979-8-4007-0574-8","","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10699931","• Software and its engineering → Search-based software engineering, Software testing and debugging","Training;Deep learning;Software testing;Collaboration;Artificial neural networks;Intellectual property;Maintenance engineering;Data models;Software;Software engineering","","","","32","","3 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the training and testing data may be collected from different domains, and the gap between the domains can significantly degrade the detectors. Test Time Adaptive Object Detection (TTA-OD) is a novel online approach that aims to adapt detectors quickly and make predictions during the testing procedure. TTA-OD is more realistic than the existing unsupervised domain adaptation and source-free unsupervised domain adaptation approaches. For example, self-driving cars need to improve their perception of new environments in the TTA-OD paradigm during driving. To address this, we propose a multi-level feature alignment (MLFA) method for TTA-OD, which is able to adapt the model online based on the steaming target domain data. For a more straightforward adaptation, we select informative foreground and background features from image feature maps and capture their distributions using probabilistic models. Our approach includes: i) global-level feature alignment to align all informative feature distributions, thereby encouraging detectors to extract domain-invariant features, and ii) cluster-level feature alignment to match feature distributions for each category cluster across different domains. Through the multi-level alignment, we can prompt detectors to extract domain-invariant features, as well as align the category-specific components of image features from distinct domains. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

To minimize the black-box effect of these models and also to make them better exploit compositionality, we propose a Dynamic Neural Network (DMN), which can understand a particular question and then dynamically assemble various relatively shallow deep learning modules from a pool of modules to form a network. We incorporate compositional temporal attention to these deep learning based modules to increase compositionality exploitation. This results in achieving better understanding of complex questions and also provides reasoning as to why the module predicts a particular answer.

Research has mainly focused on specific topics, that can enable the feasibility of robust artificial autonomous agents for autonomous vehicles (AVs), ranging from artificial vision, to automatic environmental sensing and inference, agent-agent interaction and sensor augmentation and integration. A somewhat reduced effort has been directed towards the evaluation of human-AV interaction and in the direction of defining acceptable rules of engagement when AV deal with human drivers. This aspect of autonomous driving will became extremely relevant in the next years as level 5 AVs will make their appearance on our streets and most of the cars will still be driven by humans. To assess, experimentally, how AVs can successfully interact with human drivers we have constructed a lab setup, which can simulate a large range of situations in which human drivers encounter AVs and interact with them. Based on the Unity Gaming Engine an urban environment has been developed where AVs interact with human driven cars, pedestrians and various agents. This setup allows for human subjects to drive in a virtual reality (VR) environment, and assess their behavior during the interaction with other human drivers and AVs. The goal is to define a set of rules that can be applied in AV design, to make autonomous cars react to human drivers, taking into account the behavioral patterns and variable respect of traffic regulations that human drivers exhibit in real environments. We present an early experimental setup, potentially useful for understanding, in a quantitative and reproducible way, how this approach can contribute in designing AVs that are more suited for large scale deployment.","","978-8-8872-3749-8","10.23919/AEITAUTOMOTIVE50086.2020.9307438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9307438","simulation;autonomous driving;human-machine interaction","Solid modeling;Automobiles;Vehicles;Autonomous vehicles;Engines;Software;Computational modeling","","1","","29","","4 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Allen Cypher has been invited to present a retrospective of Stagecast Creator - a visual programming environment for children. Creator enables children to create their own interactive simulations and video games by demonstrating what the characters should do. In addition to being a creativity tool, Creator also teaches children the fundamental concepts behind programming, without burdening them with the syntax and vocabulary of a textual programming language. An important part of the Stagecast Creator project is the built-in tutorial, and Allen will discuss the creation and testing of the tutorial. Researchers who tested Creator in classrooms found significant conceptual problems, and their research led to improvements in the language and tutorial. Stagecast Creator started out as KidSim - a research project by Allen Cypher and David Canfield Smith in Apple's Advanced Technology Group in the early '90s. A version called Cocoa was released by Apple, and Creator finally came out as a product from Stagecast Software, Inc. in 1998. Stagecast Creator is being used today in a variety of schools across the U.S., the U.K., and other countries, and it is popular in computer summer camps. This talk will include an assessment of the successes and shortcomings of Creator from the perspective of a decade of use. Allen will also discuss and compare Creator with other important visual programming environments for children, such as Agentsheets and ToonTalk.

The system utilizes a decentralized filtering framework and leverages three parallel subsystems: IMU/LiDAR, IMU/Camera and GNSS/INS to accurately estimate the pose of autonomous vehicles in real-time. The LiDAR and the camera subsystems combine high-frequency IMU information to estimate the pose through graph optimization. At the data fusion stage, the uniform motion model and the innovation covariance are exploited for fault diagnosis and isolation of harmful observations. Extended experiments are performed on the KAIST dataset and our self-recorded off-road environments. The experimental results show that our method achieves root mean square errors of 3.85m for average trajectory error over a total length of 11.06km, which indicates that our multi-sensor fusion positioning method can maintain high accuracy and fault tolerance in environments where GNSS is interfered and environmental features are sparse.","2771-7372","979-8-3503-1630-8","10.1109/ICUS58632.2023.10318346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10318346","autonomous vehicle;fault tolerance;multi-source information fusion","Global navigation satellite system;Fault tolerance;Laser radar;Filtering;Fault tolerant systems;Data integration;Cameras","","","","34","IEEE","21 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Human drivers drive background vehicles to randomly challenge self-driving cars according to the competition requirements, which can efficiently test the comprehensive performance of perception, decision-making, and control of self-driving cars. However, in some extreme and dangerous scenarios, utilizing real vehicles to interact with self-driving cars will definitely lead to a safety issue. For this reason, this paper adopts the combination of realistic and virtual to construct a driving simulator-based artificial intervention system for self-driving tests.

This article is the first to investigate the zero-shot fault detection (ZSFD) problem for UAV sensors, which considers the most challenging scenario where there are no fault data provided for model training. Therefore, a novel convolutional variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network (CVAE-GAN) is proposed, which is designed with a discriminator, and a generator consisting of two encoders and one decoder. First, a fixed-length sliding window is used on normal data of multiple sensors to construct multidimensional input samples, and the generator first learns the latent distribution of fault-free data in adversarial training. Then, the CVAE-GAN generates large reconstruction errors for unseen fault data in testing, which are used as anomaly scores to be compared with adaptive thresholds to achieve fine-grained detection of different sensor faults. Finally, comprehensive experimental results based on real sensor data from a UAV demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in performing ZSFD tasks with different sensor faults, especially in detecting bias, stuck, and impact faults in magnetometer, where the GM metrics outperform the compared models by approximately 7% on average, and the test time efficiency opens up the possibility of realizing online fault detection.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2024.3405630","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFB3308800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52275480); Guizhou Province Higher Education Project(grant numbers:QJH KY [2020]005); Guizhou University Natural Sciences Special Project under Grant Guida Tegang Hezi(grant numbers:(2023)61); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10551706","Convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE);fault detection;generative adversarial network (GAN);unmanned aerial vehicle sensors;zero shot","Sensors;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Intelligent sensors;Generative adversarial networks;Fault detection;Training;Data models","","13","","42","IEEE","6 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simulation tools can complement this testing process, as they can fabricate synthetic data based on variable specifications of test cases. While simulative tools can produce a vast amount of test data, at some point, the testing process is limited by the available computing resources.

Additionally, a locality module is incorporated to enhance local perception. The performance of the suggested model is evaluated on the Persian Traffic Sign Dataset and German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark and compared with SOTA convolutional and transformer-based models. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that the hybrid network with the locality module outperforms pure transformer-based models and some of the best convolutional networks in accuracy.

The core idea behind this method is the integrated design of the observer gains and the feedback gains that incorporate the fault duration and convex design of the controller parameters by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The proposed control scheme guarantees that the closed-loop system maintains input-to-state stability (ISS), while the error signals theoretically converge to a small neighborhood of the origin.

In the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Tactical Undersea Network Architectures (TUNA) program, docking a vehicle is a key enabler for several of the proposed concepts of operation. To support the program, a series of risk reduction tests were performed to characterize the docking process of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with a suspended dock. Two methods of docking were performed: a “soft” optical dock where the vehicle tracked and followed a suspended light emitting diode (LED) beacon and a hard physical dock where the vehicle entered a tubular structure. This docking demonstration and associated data will provide design support information for the various approaches being considered for implementing TUNA and other program solutions. At-Sea Testing was performed at San Clemente Island from 18–27 April 2016. Over the course of 3 days of testing, 42 test runs were performed with the vehicle in open water conditions. Of the 11 soft docking trials performed, there were six successful soft docks, one lasting in excess of 22 minutes. Of the 25 hard docking test runs, 6 were full docks and 5 were close-docks. Overall this test sequence showed that soft docking can be performed reliably in an at-sea environment, and that hard docking requires a hydrodynamic mass differential of 5 to 1 or greater.","","978-0-6929-4690-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8232267","docking;unmanned underwater vehicles;autonomous underwater vehicle","Testing;Adaptive optics;Light emitting diodes;Underwater autonomous vehicles;Software;Meters;Target tracking","","1","","6","","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The bond graph (BG) tool is an adequate tool for dynamic modeling of complex systems and performing fault detection and isolation. The innovative interest of the proposed approach is to extend the use of this tool for verification of structural recoverability conditions by exploiting the behavioral, structural, and causal properties of the BG tool.

This article introduces the concept of covert attacks on autonomous vehicles which can jeopardize the safety of passengers. Covert attacks are designed to manipulate outputs of cyber physical systems through network channels in a way that while the changes are not easily perceptible by human beings, systems are negatively affected in the long run. We argue that future smart vehicles are vulnerable to viruses which can use adversarial learning methods to adapt themselves to hosts and remain stealth for a long period. As a case study, we design a covert attack on the lane keeping system of autonomous vehicles. In the scenario, an intelligent adversary manipulates sensor readings (lane position, curvature, etc.) in order to deceive the controller to drive the vehicle closer to the boundaries. The virus/attacker interactively learns the host vehicle behaviors in terms of lateral deviation and maneuverability and tries to increase the errors to the extent that remains unnoticeable to the driver. This process is carried out through actor-critic learning based on the Newton--Raphson method. We additionally design an intrusion detection system for such covert attacks. We use the GPS data and offline maps to reconstruct road curves and match them against readings. A simulation testbed is developed based on the map of Nurburgring-Grand Prix track to evaluate our models. Results confirm the validity and effectiveness of the proposed models.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2021.3064816","Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences(grant numbers:CS1400-4-222); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9373943","Adversarial machine learning;covert attack;cyber–physical systems (CPSs);fault diagnosis and prognosis;intelligent control;Internet of Things (IoT) in industry;lane keeping (LK);security;unmanned autonomous systems;vehicle safety","Autonomous vehicles;Roads;Automobiles;Security;Safety;Vehicles;Mechatronics","","26","","33","IEEE","9 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With successful demonstration of neural network based autonomous driving, NVIDIA has introduced a new paradigm for autonomous driving software. The biggest challenge for self-driving cars is autonomous lateral control. An end-to-end model seems very promising in providing a complete software stack for autonomous driving. Although this system is not ready to be provided as a feature in the market today, it is one of the many steps in the right direction to make self-driving cars a reality. The work described in this paper focusses on how an end-to-end model is implemented. The subtleties of training a successful end-to-end model are highlighted with the aim of providing an insight on deep learning and software required for neural network training. Detailed analyses of data acquisition and training systems are provided and installation procedures for all required tools and software discussed. TORCS is used for developing and testing the end-to-end model. Approximately ten hours of driving data was collected from two different tracks. Using four hours of data from a track, we trained a deep neural network to steer a car inside simulation. Even with such a small training set, the end-to-end model developed demonstrated capabilities to maintain lanes and complete laps in different tracks. For a multilane track, like the one used for training, the model demonstrated an autonomy of 96.62%. For single lane unknown tracks, the model steered the vehicle successfully for 89.02% of the time. The results indicate that end-to-end learning and behavioral cloning can be used to drive autonomously in new and unknown scenarios.","2154-0373","978-1-5386-5398-2","10.1109/EIT.2018.8500102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8500102","","Training;Neural networks;Autonomous vehicles;Automobiles;Data models;Graphics processing units","","15","","18","IEEE","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, with the benchmark datasets growing huge and tremendous, exhaustive searching for the worst perception scenario (WPS) seems to be time consuming and unnecessary. To address this, we present an automatic searching scheme empowered by reinforcement learning. In this case, worst scenario mining is formulated as the discrete search on the Visual Operation Design Domain (ODD), namely scenario representation, by optimizing LSTM-RNN controller with the worst-performance reward. Moreover, a time-efficient K-reciprocal re-ranking technique is utilized to match the predicted scenario parameters with existing test data. The proposed method has been validated by finding the most challenging scenarios for various vehicle detectors on KITTI, BDD100k and our own benchmark set EVB. Furthermore, searching performances w.r.t different Visual ODDs are investigated and it is found that visual representations through generative adversarial network contribute to a better performance.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3340257","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973245,62202370); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2022GY-080); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10367809","Worst scenario search;visual operational design domain;reinforcement learning;K-reciprocal re-ranking","Testing;Visualization;Autonomous vehicles;Feature extraction;Visual perception;Machine learning algorithms;Reinforcement learning;Autonomous driving","","3","","57","IEEE","20 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the social implementation of deep learning progresses, the human and economic losses caused by inference errors are becoming increasingly problematic, making it necessary to develop methods to explain the basis for the decisions of deep learning algorithms. Although an attention mechanism-based method to visualize the regions that contribute to steering angle prediction in an automated driving task has been proposed, its explanatory capability is low. In this paper, we focus on the fact that the importance of each bit in the activation value of a network is biased (i.e., the sign and exponent bits are weighted more heavily than the mantissa bits), which has been overlooked in previous studies. Specifically, this paper quantizes network activations, encouraging important information to be aggregated to the sign bit. Further, we introduce an attention mechanism restricted to the sign bit to improve the explanatory power. Our numerical experiment using the Udacity dataset revealed that the proposed method achieves a  $1.14\times $  higher area under curve (AUC) in terms of the deletion metric.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3264855","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(grant numbers:21H03409); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10092762","Self-driving;explainable AI;attention;quantized neural network","Neural networks;Feature extraction;Predictive models;Visualization;Autonomous automobiles;Convolutional neural networks;Cameras","","2","","19","CCBYNCND","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet, approaches to quantify the extent to which a dataset covers test specifications that capture critical scenarios remain limited in their ability to discriminate between inputs that lead to distinct behaviors, and to render interpretations that are relevant to AV domain experts. To address this challenge, we introduce S3C, a framework that abstracts sensor inputs to coverage domains that account for the spatial semantics of a scene. The approach leverages scene graphs to produce a sensor-independent abstraction of the AV environment that is interpretable and discriminating. We provide an implementation of the approach and a study for camera-based autonomous vehicles operating in simulation. The findings show that S3C outperforms existing techniques in discriminating among classes of inputs that cause failures, and offers spatial interpretations that can explain to what extent a dataset covers a test specification. Further exploration of S3C with open datasets complements the study findings, revealing the potential and shortcomings of deploying the approach in the wild.","1558-1225","979-8-4007-0217-4","10.1145/3597503.3639178","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2129824,2312487); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10549477","coverage;scene graph;autonomous vehicles;perception","Training;Semantics;Transforms;Tail;Generators;Autonomous vehicles;Testing","","1","","55","CCBY","14 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

LSAVs use Lidar sensors to avoid obstacles in its path. However, Lidar sensors have unreliability limitation, which consequently any decision made by sensors alone is insufficient and has let to serious accidents. This is because the difficulties to determine in the sensor fusion system, how wrong information can affect the decision made by the vehicle.

Through this study, an analytical observer processing the information obtained by physical redundancy and an octree fusion process based on a probabilistic model of occupation of the voxels.

With the availability of massive storage capabilities, high speed Internet, and the advent of Internet of Things devices, modern software systems are growing in both size and complexity. Maintaining a high quality of such complex systems while manually keeping the error rate at a minimum is a challenge. Therefore, automated detection of faulty components in a software system is important during software development and also post-delivery. Fault detection models usually needs to be trained on a labeled-balanced dataset with both faulty and nonfaulty samples. Earlier work, e.g. Mohsin et al. (2016), showed that most real fault detection training dataset are imbalanced. Thereby, the trained model gets over-fitted and classifies faulty components as non-faulty components. The consequence of a high false negative rate is cumulative and results in generating more errors when using the model in other software systems -never seen before, which is very expensive. In this paper, we propose a software defect prediction ensemble model which considers the class imbalance problem in real software datasets. We use different oversampling techniques to build an ensemble classifier that can reduce the effect of low minority samples in the defective data. The proposed approach is verified using PROMISE software engineering datasets. The results show that our ensemble oversampling technique can more greatly reduce the false negative rate compared to the standard classification techniques and identify the faulty components more accurately resulting in a less expensive detection system (lowering the rate of non-faulty predictions of faulty modules).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2817572","Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University(grant numbers:RGP-1436-039); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8320364","Software quality and fault detection;imbalanced metric data;ensemble model of detection;oversampling;highly accurate detection","Fault detection;Software systems;Training;Measurement;Prediction algorithms;Software algorithms","","92","","35","OAPA","20 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is well known that there are no universally agreed Verification and Validation (VV) methodologies to guarantee absolute safety, which is crucial for the acceptance of this technology. Existing standards focus on deterministic processes where the validation requires only a set of test cases that cover the requirements. Modern autonomous vehicles will undoubtedly include machine learning and probabilistic techniques that require a much more comprehensive testing regime due to the non-deterministic nature of the operating design domain. A rigourous statistical validation process is an essential component required to address this challenge. Most research in this area focuses on evaluating system performance in large scale real-world data gathering exercises (number of miles travelled), or randomised test scenarios in simulation. This paper presents a new approach to compute the statistical characteristics of a system's behaviour by biasing automatically generated test cases towards the worst case scenarios, identifying potential unsafe edge cases. We use reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the behaviours of simulated actors that cause unsafe behaviour measured by the well established RSS safety metric. We demonstrate that by using the method we can more efficiently validate a system using a smaller number of test cases by focusing the simulation towards the worst case scenario, generating edge cases that correspond to unsafe situations.","","978-1-7281-4149-7","10.1109/ITSC45102.2020.9294590","Australian Centre for Field Robotics; University of Sydney; Australian Government; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9294590","","Testing;Safety;Roads;Mathematical model;Markov processes;Reinforcement learning;Accidents","","26","","23","IEEE","24 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developing these systems is a difficult task, especially due to limited testing capabilities. Testing a vehicle in a closed environment is safe and controlled, but the variety of test scenarios is limited. By using mixed reality environments, one can create a diverse environment around a real test vehicle, with traffic, obstacles, and unexpected situations. The real movement of the test vehicle allows testing decision and motion planning level vehicular functions. Information from the virtual world can be considered as input to the vehicle sensor. Mixed reality or digital twin simulation environments can greatly assist the autonomous vehicle development process and also serve as a basis for validation procedures for such systems.

For instance, current test procedures do not suffice for fully automated vehicles, which are supposed to be completely in charge for the driving task and have no driver as a back up. This paper presents current challenges of testing the functionality and safety of automated vehicles derived from conducting focus groups and interviews with 26 participants from five countries having a background related to testing automotive safety-related topics. We provide an overview of the state-of-practice of testing active safety features as well as challenges that needs to be addressed in the future to ensure safety for automated vehicles.

The problem remains that such trust is notoriously difficult to guarantee in the presence of systematic faults, e.g., non-traceable errors caused by machine learning functions. One way to tackle this issue without making rather specific assumptions about the perception process is plausibility checking. Similar to the reasoning of human intuition, the final outcome of a complex black-box procedure is verified against given expectations of an object's behavior. In this article, we apply and evaluate collaborative, sensor-generic plausibility checking as a mean to detect empirical perception faults from their statistical fingerprints. Our real use case is next-generation automated driving that uses a roadside sensor infrastructure for perception augmentation, represented here by test scenarios at a German highway and a city intersection.

As the key technology in perception, deep learning (DL) based computer vision models are generally considered to be black boxes due to poor interpretability. These have exacerbated user distrust and further forestalled their widespread deployment in practical usage. This paper aims to develop explainable DL models for autonomous driving by jointly predicting potential driving actions with corresponding explanations. The explainable DL models can not only boost user trust in autonomy but also serve as a diagnostic approach to identify any model deficiencies or limitations during the system development phase. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes an explainable end-to-end autonomous driving system based on ""Transformer,"" a state-of-the-art self-attention (SA) based model. The model maps visual features from images collected by onboard cameras to guide potential driving actions with corresponding explanations, and aims to achieve soft attention over the image's global features. Findings - The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model as it exhibits superior performance (in terms of correct prediction of actions and explanations) compared to the benchmark model by a significant margin with much lower computational cost on a public data set (BDD-OIA). From the ablation studies, the proposed SA module also outperforms other attention mechanisms in feature fusion and can generate meaningful representations for downstream prediction. Originality/value - In the contexts of situational awareness and driver assistance, the proposed model can perform as a driving alarm system for both human-driven vehicles and autonomous vehicles because it is capable of quickly understanding/characterizing the environment and identifying any infeasible driving actions. In addition, the extra explanation head of the proposed model provides an extra channel for sanity checks to guarantee that the model learns the ideal causal relationships. This provision is critical in the development of autonomous systems.","2399-9802","","10.1108/JICV-06-2022-0021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10004532","Explainable deep learning;Computer vision;Transformer;Autonomous driving","Computational modeling;Predictive models;Transformers;Autonomous vehicles;Training;Head;Visualization","","6","","","","30 Dec 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Big companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. invest a lot of time and money to perform online testing. The prohibitive costs of these approaches are an entry barrier for smaller players. Further, the lack of a substantial user-base can be problematic to ensure statistical significance within a reasonable duration. In this paper we propose Kaleidoscope, an automated tool to evaluate Web features at a large scale, quickly, accurately, and at a reasonable price. Kaleidoscope can test two crucial user-perceived Web features - the style and page loading. As far as we know, it is the first testing tool to replay page loading by controlling visual changes on a webpage. Kaleidoscope allows to concurrently load a webpage in two versions (e.g., different fonts, with vs without ads) that are shown to a participant side-by-side. Further, Kaleidoscope also allows a participant to interact with each webpage version and provide feedback, e.g., respond to a questionnaire previously prepared by an ""experimenter"". Kaleidoscope supports both voluntary and paid testers from FigureEight, a popular crowdsourcing platform. Using hundreds of FigureEight testers, we validate that Kaleidoscope matches the accuracy of trusted in-lab tests while providing results about 12x faster (and arguably at a lower cost) than A/B testing. Finally, we showcase how to use Kaleidoscope's page loading feature to study the user-perceived page load time (uPLT) of a webpage.","2575-8411","978-1-7281-2519-0","10.1109/ICDCS.2019.00195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8885005","Web testing;Crowdsourcing;A/B testing;Page loading;Quality of Experience","Testing;Tools;Loading;Crowdsourcing;Browsers;Complexity theory;Quality of experience","","5","","60","IEEE","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One goal of safety testing is to estimate the risk rate of HAVs in naturalistic driving environment and compare them with human drivers. Due to the low exposure of risk events, such statistic estimation requires massive tests accumulation. To address this problem, we propose an enhanced accelerated testing method which combines the Importance Sampling and Normalizing Flows together. Importance Sampling can replace the naturalistic probability density function with a new one where rare events are more likely to occur. Considering that fitting Importance Sampling distribution with conventional parametric distributions is limited., the method of Normalizing Flows is introduced. It is capable to learn the distribution of rare events and to estimate Importance Sampling distribution by applying a sequence of invertible transformations. Normalizing Flows also maintains the correlated relationship between scenario variables. We apply it on naturalistic Car-following scenarios and estimate the collision rate of our System Under Test (SUT). It shows the combined method reduces the number of tests by 253 times compared to Monte Carlo when the relative half width reaches the required accuracy. The proposed method has great potential in accelerating the safety assessment of HAVs.","","978-1-6654-6880-0","10.1109/ITSC55140.2022.9922218","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52172391); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9922218","","Monte Carlo methods;Planets;Life estimation;Probability density function;Weaving;Safety;Reliability","","5","","26","IEEE","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing literature has demonstrated that subtle perturbations to the input can elicit erroneous outcomes, thereby substantially compromising the security of DL systems. This has emerged as a critical concern in the development of DL-based safety–critical systems like autonomous driving systems (ADSs). The focus of existing adversarial attack methods on end-to-end (E2E) ADSs has predominantly centered on misbehaviors of steering angle, which overlooks speed-related controls or imperceptible perturbations. To address these challenges, we introduce UniAda–a multiobjective white-box attack technique with a core function that revolves around crafting an image-agnostic adversarial perturbation capable of simultaneously influencing both steering and speed controls. UniAda capitalizes on an intricately designed multiobjective optimization function with the adaptive weighting scheme (AWS), enabling the concurrent optimization of diverse objectives. Validated with both simulated and real-world driving data, UniAda outperforms five benchmarks across two metrics, inducing steering and speed deviations from 3.54$^{\circ }$ to 29$^{\circ }$ and 11 to 22 km/h on average.

The testing scenario generation method, especially for critical scenarios, is the vital step for development and deployment of shared control vehicles. The research presented in this paper focuses on a Nash game based shared control strategy and its critical testing scenario generation method. The driving authority allocation strategy basing on the traffic situation and driving capability is established firstly. In this part, both the traffic situation and driving capability are quantified and a fuzzy rule is proposed to allocate the driving authority. The knowledge of non-cooperative game and Nash equilibrium theory are applied to obtain the optimal shared control strategy. In the given operational design domain (ODD), testing scenarios can be evaluated by a novel proposed indicator, scenario importance, which can be computed as the combination of risk degree and occurrence probability. Test results show that the proposed shared control strategy can intervene drivers’ operation in different scenario risk degrees to ensure safety and improve driving acceptability and the scenario generated method can validate the proposed share control system reasonably and effectively as well.","","978-1-6654-8090-1","10.1109/AEECA55500.2022.9919034","Nature; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Technology Development; National Social Science Fund of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9919034","shared control;Nash game;critical testing scenarios","Electrical engineering;Computational modeling;Games;Computer applications;Nash equilibrium;Control systems;Safety","","","","11","IEEE","18 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far, mixed reality environments have been proposed to provide an efficient way of virtual testing and also allow for more realistic interactions between vulnerable road users and automated vehicles. In this work, we investigate the use of different pedestrian representations with varying levels of fidelity (articulated pedestrian target, animated pedestrian, full-body motion capture) regarding their impact on the performance of an exemplary AEB driving function. The results show that the detection of the underlying algorithm and the function's response differ only slightly for the three pedestrian representations.

Specifically, search-based approaches are used to find particularly critical situations. These approaches provide an opportunity to automatically generate tests; however, system-atically producing bug-revealing tests for ADS remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce DoppelTest, a test generation approach for ADSes that utilizes a genetic algorithm to discover bug-revealing violations by generating scenarios with multiple autonomous vehicles that account for traffic control (e.g., traffic signals and stop signs).

In this work, we present a new safety validation approach that attempts to estimate the distribution over failures of an autonomous policy using approximate dynamic programming. Knowledge of this distribution allows for the efficient discovery of many failure examples. To address the problem of scalability, we decompose complex driving scenarios into subproblems consisting of only the ego vehicle and one other vehicle. These subproblems can be solved with approximate dynamic programming and their solutions are recombined to approximate the solution to the full scenario. We apply our approach to a simple two-vehicle scenario to demonstrate the technique as well as a more complex five-vehicle scenario to demonstrate scalability. In both experiments, we observed an increase in the number of failures discovered compared to baseline approaches.","","978-1-7281-4149-7","10.1109/ITSC45102.2020.9294636","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9294636","","Safety;Autonomous vehicles;1/f noise;Trajectory;Testing;Markov processes;Scalability","","6","","28","IEEE","24 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When any constraint is violated, an inconsistency is said to occur and then follow-up actions can be taken to remedy the problem. Currently, various constraint checking techniques have been proposed and implemented with sophisticated mechanisms for higher efficiency and scalability. However, these implementations could be far from being well tested due to their oracle problems, i.e., hardly able to tell what the checking result should be, given any software artifacts and their consistency constraints to check.

Training data can contain faults, especially when collected through crowdsourcing. Ensembles, consisting of multiple ML models voting on predictions, have been found to be an effective resilience technique. Ensembles are resilient when their constituent models behave independently during inference, by focusing on different features in an input. However, independence is not observed on every input, resulting in mispredictions. One way to improve ensemble resilience is to dynamically weigh predictions during inference by its constituent models instead of treating each model equally. While previous work on dynamically weighted models in ensembles has relied upon output diversity metrics due to efficiency, we focus on the feature-space of inputs for accuracy. Hence, we propose the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to dynamically adjust the weight of ensemble models based on local feature-space diversity.","2833-292X","979-8-3503-9570-9","10.1109/DSN-S60304.2024.00018","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10647092","Error resilience;Machine learning;Explainability","Measurement;Crowdsourcing;Accuracy;Explainable AI;Training data;Focusing;Medical services","","","","26","IEEE","29 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Obstacle maps are used in the HAV control system for avoiding moving and stationary targets and for localization in conjunction with other positioning tools. The EKF module is used to estimate the position of landmarks and the vehicle itself based on the data received from the front cameras. The data processing involves converting the images into Birds-Eye-View (BEV) projections using an Inverted Perspective Map (IPM) to account for spatial information. The paper describes the methods and algorithms used for image processing, object recognition using a neural network with YOLOv8 architecture, and determination of free space for movement using semantic segmentation based on MobileNetV3 neural network architecture. The results of testing the developed methods and software in the Webots modeling environment are also presented, and the prospects for the development and improvement of the system are discussed.

The basic framework of this paper can be viewed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning in which different agents will exchange their strategies after each round of learning to reach a zero-sum game state. Unlike cooperation driving, harmonious driving only relies on individual vehicles’ limited sensing results to balance overall and individual efficiency. Specifically, we propose a well-designed reward that combines individual efficiency with overall efficiency for harmony, instead of only emphasizing individual interests like competitive strategy. Testing results show that competitive strategy often leads to selfish lane change behaviors, anarchy of crowd, and thus the degeneration of traffic efficiency. In contrast, the proposed harmonious strategy can promote traffic efficiency in both free flow and traffic jam than the competitive strategy. This interesting finding indicates that we should take care of the reward setting for reinforcement learning-based AI robots (e.g., automated vehicles) design, when the utilities of these robots are not strictly in alignment.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3047129","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101402); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61790565); Shenzhen Municipal Science and Technology Innovation Committee(grant numbers:JCYJ20170412172030008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9325948","Lane changing;reinforcement learning;deep learning","Reinforcement learning;Vehicle-to-everything;Space vehicles;Sensors;Roads;Mathematical model;Delays","","60","","46","IEEE","15 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
